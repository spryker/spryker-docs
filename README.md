## Working with AI Agents

This repository includes instructions for AI agents to help with documentation tasks. These instructions are maintained in three identical files:

- `.github/instructions/copilot-instructions.md` - Instructions for GitHub Copilot
- `AGENTS.md` - Instructions for general [AI agents](https://agents.md/)
- `CLAUDE.md` - Instructions for Claude Code

**Important:** All three files must contain identical content. When updating agent instructions, make sure to update all three files to maintain consistency.
