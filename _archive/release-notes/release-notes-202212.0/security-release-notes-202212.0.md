## CmsGui:5.6.0 added XSS sanitizing options without adding spryker/form dependency

XSS sanitizing options have been added for CmsGui version [5.6.0](https://github.com/spryker/cms-gui/releases/tag/5.6.0). However, the version failed if these options were not extended by `SanitizeXssTypeExtensionFormPlugin`.

**Changes:**
- Gui module:
    - Introduced the `SanitizeXssTypeExtensionFormPlugin` plugin to register the `SanitizeXssTypeExtension` extension that extends `TextType` and `TextAreaType` form types with such options as `sanitize_xss`, `allowed_attributes` and `allowed_html_tags` to enable and configure XSS sanitizing on text fields.
    - Added `GuiToUtilSanitizeXssServiceInterface` to dependencies.
    - Added `spryker/util-sanitize-xss` to dependencies.

- CmsGui module:
Adjusted CmsGlossaryTranslationFormType to enable XSS sanitizing for the translation field.

**Affected modules:**
spryker/cms-gui (5.6.0)

**How to get the fix:**
1. Check the version of the related modules:
- spryker/gui (3.29.0)
- spryker/cms-gui (5.6.0)
- spryker/form (1.0.0)
2. Update the modules if the versions are earlier than those mentioned above. For example:

```bash
composer update spryker/cms-gui`
```
3. Add `Spryker\Zed\Gui\Communication\Plugin\Form\SanitizeXssTypeExtensionFormPlugin` to `\Pyz\Zed\Form\FormDependencyProvider::getFormPlugins()` on the project level.

## Twig - twig could load a template outside of a configured directory when the filesystem loader was used
There was a vulnerability in PHP package twig/twig. When using the filesystem loader to load templates for which the name is user input, it was possible to use the source or include a statement to read arbitrary files from outside of the templates directory.

**Changes:**
Twig module:
Increased the `twig/twig` dependency version to ensure the security issue on the filesystem loader is resolved.

**Affected modules:**
spryker/twig (3.17.0 or earlier)

**How to get the fix:**
1. Update the module: `composer update spryker/twig`
2. Make sure that the current version of the `spryker/twig` twig module is equal to or later than 3.17.1.

## Missing validation of the wishlist name on adding an item

Because of the way the characters are handled, it was possible to abuse the name in a way that the constructed URL linked to another resource of the shop instead of the wishlist.

**Changes:**
Wishlist module:

- Introduced the `WishlistItemAddItemPreCheckPlugin` plugin implementing `AddItemPreCheckPluginInterface` to validate wishlist item before adding to wishlist.
- Adjusted `WishlistFacade::addItem()` to validate item's wishlist name before adding to wishlist.
- Adjusted `WishlistFacade::addItemCollection()` to validate item's wishlist name before adding to wishlist.
WishlistPage module:
- Adjusted `WishlistController::addItemAction()` to redirect to the wishlist overview page when wishlist item is not added successfully.
- Adjusted `WishlistController::addItemAction()` to create a default wishlist when wishlist name is not provided.
- Introduced the `WishlistResponse.wishlist` transfer field.
- Added the Transfer module to dependencies.

**Affected modules:**
spryker/wishlist (8.6.0 or earlier)

**How to get the fix:**
1. Update the module:
```bash
`composer update spryker/wishlist`
```
2. If Yves is used, also update the WishlistPage module: `composer update spryker/wishlist-page`
3. Make sure that for these modules the current version is equal to or later than the following:
- spryker/wishlist: 8.7.0
- spryker-shop/wishlist-page: 1.11.0
4. Add `Spryker\Zed\Wishlist\Communication\Plugin\Wishlist\WishlistItemAddItemPreCheckPlugin` to `Pyz/Zed/Wishlist/WishlistDependencyProvider::getAddItemPreCheckPlugins()` on the project level.

## User enumeration when creating a customer via the API
It was possible to enumerate users if creating them via the API. The message in response was "Customer with this email already exists."

**Changes:**
The response message has been changed as follows: "If this email address is already in use, you will receive a password reset link. Otherwise you must first validate your e-mail address to finish registration. Check your e-mail."

**Affected modules:**
No changes.

**How to get the fix:**
Update the translation in the `data/import/common/common/glossary.csv for customer.authorization.invalid_account` key.

## ZED token default value can be empty
The default Zed tokens could be empty if it was not set during installation.

**Changes:**
We've removed the default value `SPRYKER_ZED_REQUEST_TOKEN`. The value has to be set or the fallback value must be properly handled with an exception.

**Affected modules:**
No changes.

**How to get the fix:**
In the related config files like `config/Shared/config_default.php`, remove the default value for the default value `SPRYKER_ZED_REQUEST_TOKEN`.

## Leakage of table names and parameters when inserting long strings in the file directory name
When creating a new directory within the file tree (*Content > File Tree*) it was possible to
include very long strings in the name.

## Missing CSRF protection in ZED (File Manager > MIME Type Settings)
While a request usually contained a CSRF token in form of an HTTP POST parameter, the token could still be simply omitted from the request, as it was not checked on the server-side when the *_method* parameter highlighted in red was specified. Since the SameSite attribute was not set for the session cookie in the administrative backend, a third-party website could simply embed the HTML code which could submit a form on behalf of the user and lead to the deletion of content for logged-in users.


**Changes:**
FileManagerGui module:
Adjusted `MimeTypeController::deleteAction()` so it uses CSRF protection for the MIME type deletion.


**Affected modules:**
spryker/file-manager-gui (2.0.0 or earlier)

**How to get the fix:**
Update the modules:
```bash
composer update spryker/file-manager-gui
```
Make sure that for the spryker/file-manager-gui module, the current version is equal to or later than 2.1.0.

## Cross Domain Script Include
The application loads a subset of included JavaScript files from third-party domains.
If the application included a script from an external domain, then the application is entrusting that domain with the application's data and functionality. It has to trust that the external domain is secure enough to prevent an attacker from modifying the script to perform malicious actions within the application.

**Changes:**

- Gui module:
Adjusted the `backward-compatible-breadcrumb.twig` template to remove breadcrumbs web-component with dependencies and restore the default breadcrumbs functionality.

- ZedNavigation module:
Adjusted `BreadcrumbHelper::seeBreadcrumbNavigation()` in to support two possible breadcrumbs frontend components.

**Affected modules:**
spryker/gui (3.43.1 or earlier)

**How to get the fix:**
1. Update the modules:
```bash
composer update spryker/gui
```
```bash
spryker/zed-navigation
```
2. Make sure that the current version is equal to or later than the following:
- spryker/gui (3.44.0)
- spryker/zed-navigation (1.12.1)
