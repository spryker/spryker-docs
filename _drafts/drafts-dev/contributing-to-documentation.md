We at Spryker aim to constantly improve the content we provide our customers and partners with. You can get involved in improving the Spryker documentation by reporting issues and editing documentation via pull requests on GitHub.

{% info_block infoBox %}

To report issues and fix documentation, you need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join). Make sure you are logged in to proceed with issue reports and pull requests.

{% endinfo_block %}

We use [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to write documentation and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to build the documentation site. You do not necessarily need to build the documentation site locally on your machine to propose your changes, but if you want to, follow the instructions in [Build documentation site](/docs/about/all/about-the-docs/run-the-docs-locally.html).
