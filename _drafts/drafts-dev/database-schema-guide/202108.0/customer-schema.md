## Customer Schema

### Customer with Addresses

Customers can register themselves directly or during the checkout. They can log in and log out to the shop and use the password forgotten mechanism.

**Structure**:

* **Customer**: Here we save the basic information like the name and the preferred locale.

  - *spy_customer::customer_reference* - the Public reference to the customer which does not allow conclusions on the number of customers in the database.

* **Address**: Each customer can have multiple addresses while only one of them can be the default billing and shipping address.

### Customer Groups

Customers can be grouped so that they qualify for specific discounts. This feature can also be used for other use cases like "customer-group specific prices".

### Newsletter

Shop users can subscribe to the newsletter.

* **Structure**:
* Newsletter subscribers are saved into *spy_newsletter_subscriber*.
* Subscribers can be related to existing customers or they can be standalone.
* Subscribers can be related to one or multiple subscriptions.
