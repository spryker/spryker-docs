## Shipment

### Shipment carriers, method and price

{% info_block infoBox %}
The customer can select a shipment method and a related carrier during the checkout. Each shipment method has a dedicated price and tax set.
{% endinfo_block %}

**Structure**:

* A Shipment Method has a name (e.g. "Express") and a Carrier (e.g. "DHL")
* Each Shipment Method has a default net/gross price per currency and per store
* The `spy_shipment_method::price` field is deprecated

### Shipment Configuration

In some use cases, shipments can become complicated. For this reason, the Shipment Method has three hooks for plugins.

| Optional Plugin | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
|  `availability_plugin` | Determines if the shipment method is selectable for the current quote (Default: Yes) |
|  `price_plugin` | This plugin enables overriding the default prices. For instance, the price of the shipment may depend on the weight of a product or the distance to the customer's shipment address. |
|  `delivery_time_plugin` | Allows defining a delivery date |
