Spryker lets you customize everything, but there are different approaches to customization. You don't have to stick to just one approach, but the approaches you choose will impact security, customers' experience and the effort for upgrading your project.

## Customizing Spryker frontend

You can customize the layout, styles, and behavior of existing frontend components and create new ones. The technologies used are respectively Twig, SAAS, and Typescript or Javascript.

For detailed instructions, see [Customizing Spryker frontend](/docs/dg/dev/frontend-development/202311.0/yves/atomic-frontend/customizing-spryker-frontend.html).

## Customizing Spryker backend

When it comes to customizing the backend, you will learn the difference between the core and project levels. Because all the backend functionality is contained in modules, to customize functionality, you are going to extend the modules. If you need to implement completely new functionality, you can create a completely new module.

For detailed instructions, see [Extend Spryker](/docs/dg/dev/backend-development/extend-spryker/extend-spryker.html).
