## Why you need to install locally

Most of the development work happens on your machine. Before changes are pushed to cloud environments, you can add, test, and see how they work locally.

## Who needs to install locally

We streamlined and simplified the process of installing Spryker, so all the people related to the development of your project can do it easily.

The following categories need to install Spryker:

Engineers: Add and test changes.

Business users: Check out changes during the early stages of development.

## Installation guides
