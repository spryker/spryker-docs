The goal of this doc is to enable you to find solutions to problems more efficiently and quickly. You can always count on our support, but the support channel isn't always the fastest way to get your problem solved. We structured this doc in the order of priority of information channels you need to use when solving an issue.


## Spryker docs

Spryker docs are the central hub of sharing knowledge about Spryker. By covering the most common topics in the docs, we strive to enable you to resolve issues on your own without waiting for support. So, before you create a support case, make sure to use the docs search to find solutions faster.


## CommerceQuest

Spryker is a very flexible and customizable solution, and we don't expect to cover everything in the docs. You will inevitably run into edge cases, but you might not be the first person to run into a particular case. The experienced Spryker community at [CommerceQuest](https://commercequest.space/) solved hundreds of cases, and that valuable information is available to you. Make sure to search by posts before creating your own. 


## Spryker support

Depending on the type of issues, there are several ways to report them and request support from us:

* For bug reports and product issues, create a case at the [support portal](https://support.spryker.com).

* For security issues, follow the instructions at [Security Support](/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/support/handling-security-issues.html).
