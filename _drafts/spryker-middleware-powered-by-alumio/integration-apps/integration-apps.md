An Integration App is a flexible end-to-end solution that aims to build data integrations in close to one day. With an Integration App, you have access to the default data mappings, transformers, data validators and other preset configurations for a specific data integration use-case.
Spryker Integration Apps are built using Spryker demoshops data models as a default mapping, that you may use and then adjust the configuration to you specific use-case.
Spryker provides the [Akeneo PIM Integration App](/docs/pbc/all/data-exchange/{{page.version}}/spryker-middleware-powered-by-alumio/integration-apps/akeneo-pim-integration-app/akeneo-pim-integration-app.html) that lets you import products from Akeneo PIM to Spryker Cloud Commerce OS.
