This guide describes how to install applications. When an application is installed, the Launchpad automatically deploys all the changes in its GitHub repository.

To install an application, do the following:

1. On the *List of Applications* page, select the application you want to publish.
    This opens the pane of the application.

2. In the *Hosting provider* section, select *Install Application*.

This shows the success message. Now the code changes are automatically deployed.
