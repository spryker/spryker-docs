## Early Access Program

As part of Spryker's Early Access Program, we use your feedback to refine early-access features that are still under development. This section describes how the program works and how you can participate.


### Program goals

- Integration and compatibility testing: Evaluate how well the tool integrates into various Spryker projects.  
- Identify gaps and issues: Because this is a third-party tool using another third-party tool, Spryker is not in control of how ChatGPT behaves. There may be unexpected issues and unsatisfactory results which we need to track and collect to understand if they can be improved upon.  
- Understand user onboarding and learning curve: 
  - Evaluate if the tool can be successfully used by engineers with varying levels of expertise.
  - Assess whether engineers can effectively use the tool without extensive training and derive valuable insights for testing processes.
- Drive adoption: Promote the usage of comprehensive functional testing checklists and dependency analysis, providing an easy entry point for users.  
- Gather case studies and success stories: Gather case studies and success stories of early users who derived significant value from the tool.


Your feedback will help us understand if we are meeting these goals effectively.


## Early Access Program

Early Access Program enables real-world testing of our product's new capabilities and tools. This helps us refine and improve the product based on feedback from partners and customers. 

Early access release GPTs may be unsupported and are subject to change, potentially leading to changes or discontinuation before a general availability release.

### Participate

You can start participating by using the tool and providing feedback.

### Provide feedback

You can provide feedback through surveys, interviews, and [Feedback Exchange Portal](https://portal.productboard.com/spryker/2-feedback-exchange).

### Iteration and improvement

Based on your feedback, we will continuously improve Spryker GPTs.

### Program shutdown activities

We will announce the program shutdown two weeks in advance. After that, we will transition the tool to a General Availability Release, or discontinue it based on our analysis. Regardless of the outcome, we will communicate the next steps, learnings, and insights from the program.
