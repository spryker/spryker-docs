The integration guides provide step-by-step instructions on how to enable individual Spryker features for your project.

Please keep in mind, that since Spryker Commerce OS is a highly modular system, you have total freedom in choosing what features to add to your project. When making a decision to install new features, we recommend not to bloat your project by installing everything, but opt for the features that are really justified in terms of your business needs.

If you have spotted an issue with either of the guides,  feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/spryker/spryker-docs/issues) or pull request by using the Edit on GitHub option.
