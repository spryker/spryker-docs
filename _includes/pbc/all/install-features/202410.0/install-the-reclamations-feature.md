### 3) Set up behavior

Enable the following behaviors by registering the plugins:

| PLUGIN | SPECIFICATION | PREREQUISITES | NAMESPACE |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ReclamationSalesTablePlugin | Expands sales order table with a "Claim" button, that redirects to "Create Reclamation" page, where the whole order or its specific items can be reclaimed. | None | Spryker\Zed\SalesReclamationGui\Communication\Plugin\Sales |

**src/Pyz/Zed/Sales/SalesDependencyProvider.php**

```php
<?php

namespace Pyz\Zed\Sales;

use Spryker\Zed\Sales\SalesDependencyProvider as SprykerSalesDependencyProvider;
use Spryker\Zed\SalesReclamationGui\Communication\Plugin\Sales\ReclamationSalesTablePlugin;

class SalesDependencyProvider extends SprykerSalesDependencyProvider
{
	/**
	 * @return \Spryker\Zed\SalesExtension\Dependency\Plugin\SalesTablePluginInterface[]
	 */
	protected function getSalesTablePlugins()
	{
		return [
			new ReclamationSalesTablePlugin(),
		];
	}
}
```

{% info_block warningBox "Verification" %}

Make sure that the sales order table in the back office has a "Claim" button for each order, clicking on which will redirect you to create reclamation page.

{% endinfo_block %}
