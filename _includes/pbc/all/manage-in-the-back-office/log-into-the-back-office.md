If you are not logged into the Back Office, take the following steps.

## Prerequisites

- To log in with a Back Office account, create and activate the account in **Users&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Users**. An existing Back Office user or a developer can create accounts. For detailed instructions, see [Create users](/docs/pbc/all/user-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/manage-in-the-back-office/manage-users/create-users.html).
- To log in with a single sign-on(SSO), check the requirements with your development team. For more details about SSO authentication, see [Identity Access Management](/docs/pbc/all/identity-access-management/{{page.version}}/identity-access-management.html).


## Log in with a Back Office account

On the Back Office login page, enter the **EMAIL** and **PASSWORD** of your account and click **Login**.

If you don't have a login URL, your Back Office administrator or a developer can provide you with it.


## Restore a Back Office password

1. On the Login page, click **Forgot password?**.
2. Enter the **EMAIL** that was used for your Back Office account registration and click **Recover password**.
    You should receive an email with the link to restore your password.
3. In the email, click the change password link.
    This opens the **Reset password** page in the Back Office.
4. In the **Password** and **Repeat password** fields, enter your new password.
5. Click **Reset**.

Your password is now updated. To log in, enter the new password in the login form.

## Log in with a single sign-on

If SSO is configured for the Back Office, you can log in with a third-party account as follows:

1. In the login form, click **Login with {Third-party service name}**.
    This opens the third-party sign-in page.
2. Sign into the third-party system by entering your username and password.

This logs you in and opens the Back Office home page.
