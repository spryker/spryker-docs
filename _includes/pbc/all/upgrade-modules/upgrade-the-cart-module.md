## Upgrading from version 4.* to version 5.*

With the implementation of the quote storage strategies, the new version of the Cart module allows to use different behaviors for different strategies.
Since `QuoteClient::getStorageStrategy` method is used now, the Quote module's version must be 2.0.0 or higher.
`CartClientInterface::storeQuote` method is deprecated, remove it from your code and use `QuoteClientInterface::setQuote()` instead.
`CartClientInterface::getZedStub` method is deprecated, remove it from your code and use `\Spryker\Client\ZedRequest\ZedRequestClient::addFlashMessagesFromLastZedRequest` to push stack of ZED request messages to flash messages.

All logic from `CartClient` has been moved to `\Spryker\Client\Cart\Plugin\SessionQuoteStorageStrategyPlugin`.
Make sure that all your local overwrites of those methods have been moved there.
