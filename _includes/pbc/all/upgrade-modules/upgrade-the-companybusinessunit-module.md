## Upgrading from version 1.* to version 2.*

The second version of the `CompanyBusinessUnit` module added the parent Company Business Units functionality.
`CompanyBusinessUnit` v2.0.0 major version adds a new `fk_parent_company_business_unit`to the `spy_company_business_unit` database table:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<database xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" name="zed" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="http://static.spryker.com/schema-01.xsd" namespace="Orm\Zed\CompanyBusinessUnit\Persistence" package="src.Orm.Zed.CompanyBusinessUnit.Persistence">

    <table name="spy_company_business_unit" phpName="SpyCompanyBusinessUnit" identifierQuoting="true">
        <column name="fk_parent_company_business_unit" type="INTEGER" required="false"/>

        <foreign-key name="spy_company_business_unit-fk_parent_company_business_unit" foreignTable="spy_company_business_unit" phpName="ParentCompanyBusinessUnit" refPhpName="ChildrenCompanyBusinessUnits">
            <reference local="fk_parent_company_business_unit" foreign="id_company_business_unit"/>
        </foreign-key>
    </table>

</database>
```

This change allowed company business units to have parent company business units, which made it possible to create hierarchies of company business units inside the company.

To upgrade to the new version, do the following:

1. Update modules:

    1. Update `spryker/company-business-unit` module version in your `composer.json`:
    
    ```bash
    {
      "require": {
        "spryker/company-business-unit": "^2.0.0"
      }
    }
    ```

    2. Run `composer update` to update the installed packages. If the execution of this command fails because of the dependency issues, they should be resolved first.

2. Perform the database update and migration:

    1. Execute the following SQL query to apply `spy_company_business_unit` database table changes:

    ```SQL
    BEGIN;

    ALTER TABLE "spy_company_business_unit" ADD "fk_parent_company_business_unit" INTEGER;

    ALTER TABLE "spy_company_business_unit" ADD CONSTRAINT "spy_company_business_unit-fk_parent_company_business_unit"
      FOREIGN KEY ("fk_parent_company_business_unit")
      REFERENCES "spy_company_business_unit" ("id_company_business_unit");

    COMMIT;
    ```

    2. Execute the following commands to build Propel models:

    ```bash
    console propel:diff;
    console propel:migrate;
    console propel:model:build;
    ```

    3. Execute the `console transfer:generate` command to apply transfer objects changes.
