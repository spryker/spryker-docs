## Upgrading from version 1.* to version 2.*

Version 2.0.0 of the `ContentGui` module introduces the [Content Items](/docs/pbc/all/content-management-system/{{site.version}}/base-shop/navigation-feature-overview.html) functionality that allows creating and managing content and later selecting where it should be inserted.

The `ContentGui` module version 2.0.0 introduced the following changes:

- Adjusted models to support parameter KEY of Content.
- Introduced the `ContentTransfer::$key` transfer object property.
- Changed a header in `EditContent/index.twig` to use a key instead of the ID.
- Increased the version of `spryker/content` in composer.json.

You can find more details about the changes on the [ContentGui module release notes](https://github.com/spryker/content-gui/releases/tag/2.0.0) page.
