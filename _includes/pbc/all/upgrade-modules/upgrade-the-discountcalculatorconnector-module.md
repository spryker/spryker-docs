## Upgrading from version 4.* to version 5.*

This module no longer has any calculator plugins, except  `DiscountCalculatorPlugin`. All other plugins were moved to the separate repository in `spryker/calculation-migration`.

To learn how to migrate to the new structure see, the [Upgrading from version 3.* to version 4.*](/docs/pbc/all/cart-and-checkout/{{site.version}}/base-shop/install-and-upgrade/upgrade-modules/upgrade-the-calculation-module.html#upgrading-from-version-3-to-version-4) section in *Upgrade the Calculation module*.

## Upgrading from version 2.* to version 3.*

The tax plugins are using the version 3.* of the Tax module. See [Upgrade the Tax module](/docs/pbc/all/tax-management/{{site.version}}/base-shop/install-and-upgrade/upgrade-the-tax-module.html) for more details.

A new tax calculator must be registered in  `CalculationDependencyProvider::getCalculatorStack()`.

Add `ExpenseTaxWithDiscountsCalculatorPlugin` to the discount calculator block, after `DiscountCalculatorPlugin`.

```php
//..
use Spryker\Zed\DiscountCalculationConnector\Communication\Plugin;

class CalculationDependencyProvider extends SprykerCalculationDependencyProvider
{

    /**
     * @param \Spryker\Zed\Kernel\Container $container
     * @return \Spryker\Zed\Calculation\Dependency\Plugin\CalculatorPluginInterface[]
     */
    protected function getCalculatorStack(Container $container)
    {
        return [
            .... other existing plugins .....

            new ExpenseTaxWithDiscountsCalculatorPlugin(),

        ];
    }
```
