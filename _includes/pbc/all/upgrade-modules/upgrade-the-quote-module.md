## Upgrading from version 1.* to version 2.*

The new version of the `Quote` module provides the ability to save customer quote into the database and get it. Version 2 of the `Quote` module introduced a new schema.

Quote storage strategy (session, database) can be changed in `Spryker\Shared\Quote\QuoteConfig::getStorageStrategy`.

If you're migrating the `Quote` module from version 1 to version 2,  follow the steps described below.

### Perform database migration

- Run `vendor/bin/console propel:diff`, also manual review is necessary for the generated migration file;
- Run `vendor/bin/console propel:migrate`;
- Run `vendor/bin/console propel:model:build`.

After running the last command you'll find some new classes in your project under `\Orm\Zed\Cms\Persistence` namespace. It's important to make sure that they are extending the base classes from the core, for example, `Orm\Zed\Quote\Persistence\SpyQuote` extends `\Spryker\Zed\Quote\Persistence\Propel\AbstractSpyQuote``Orm\Zed\Quote\Persistence\SpyQuoteQuery extends Spryker\Zed\Quote\Persistence\Propel\AbstractSpyQuoteQuery.`

With this version quote storage strategies (session, database) have been added.

They implement the interface `Spryker\Client\Quote\StorageStrategy\StorageStrategyInterface`, which extends `QuoteClientInterface`.

Any of your changes from `QuoteClientInterface` should be implemented in `Spryker\Client\Quote\StorageStrategy\DatabaseStorageStrategy` and `Spryker\Client\Quote\StorageStrategy\SessionStorageStrategy`.
