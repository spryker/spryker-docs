## Upgrading from version 3.* to version 4.*

1. Update/install `spryker/touch` to at least 4.0.0 version.
2. Install the new database columns by running `vendor/bin/console propel:diff`. Propel should generate a migration file with the changes.
3. Run `vendor/bin/console propel:migrate` to apply the database changes.
4. Generate ORM models by running `vendor/bin/console propel:model:build`.
This command will update `spy_touch_storage`, and `spy_touch_search` classes to have the newly created `fk_store` columns and their relations.
5. Populate `fk_store` records respectively to `spy_touch_storage.key`, and `spy_touch_search.key`.

**Example migrations**

  1. If you have a single Store, `spy_store` contains 1 row which represents your active store. Use its `spy_store.id_store` value to update touch records.
  In our current example the store ID is considered: 1.
  ```sql
      UPDATE spy_touch_storage SET fk_store = 1;
      UPDATE spy_touch_search SET fk_store = 1;
    ```
  2. If you have multiple Stores already, you will need to create a query which updates the `fk_store` values based on the records' key (if it contains the store information).
  <br>Example update when the key has the following structure: `{STORE_NAME}.{LOCALE_NAME}.{ENTITY_NAME}.{ENTITY_ID}`.

  ```sql
  MySql:
        UPDATE spy_touch_storage JOIN spy_store SET spy_touch_storage.fk_store = spy_store.id_store
        WHERE LOWER(spy_store.name) = LOWER(SUBSTR(`key`, 1, LOCATE(`key`, '.') - 1));

        UPDATE spy_touch_search JOIN spy_store SET spy_touch_search.fk_store = spy_store.id_store
        WHERE LOWER(spy_store.name) = LOWER(SUBSTR(`key`, 1, LOCATE(`key`, '.') - 1));

  PostgreSql:
        UPDATE spy_touch_storage SET fk_store = spy_store.id_store
        FROM spy_store WHERE LOWER(spy_store.name) = LOWER(SUBSTR(key, 1, STRPOS(key, '.') - 1));

        UPDATE spy_touch_search SET fk_store = spy_store.id_store
          ROM spy_store WHERE LOWER(spy_store.name) = LOWER(SUBSTR(key, 1, STRPOS(key, '.') - 1));
  ```

6. The following deprecated methods were removed,  check your code if you have custom calls or dependencies:

   * `TouchFacadeInterface::bulkTouchActive()`
   * `TouchFacadeInterface::bulkTouchInactive()`
   * `TouchFacadeInterface::bulkTouchDeleted()`
   * `TouchQueryContainerInterface::queryTouchEntries()`
   * `TouchInterface::bulkUpdateTouchRecords()`

You can find additional details on the [Touch module release page](https://github.com/spryker/touch/releases).

7. The following methods have internal changes,  check if you have customized them:

   * `TouchQueryContainer::queryTouchDeleteStorageAndSearch()`
   * `TouchRecord::removeTouchEntriesMarkedAsDeleted()`

  You can find additional details on the [Touch module release page](https://github.com/spryker/touch/releases).
8. Note: Module requires PHP 7.1 from now on.
9. After these steps, your `Touch` module supports multi-store entities.
