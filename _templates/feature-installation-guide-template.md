<!-- This document is an installation guide template.
All the described steps are optional. If you want to add a step that's not described in the template, contact Karoly Gerner.


Before you start, check out the formatting templates in [Formatting templates for feature integration guides](formatting-templates-for-feature-integration-guides.md).-->

This document describes how to install the [Feature Name feature]({link to a respective feature overview}) feature.

## Install feature core <!-- Skip if there won't be a frontend section in the doc -->

Follow the steps below to install the {Feature Name} feature core.

### Prerequisites
<!-- List the features a project must have before they can install the current feature. -->

Install the required features and Glue APIs:
<!--See feature mapping at [Features](https://release.spryker.com/features). -->

| NAME           | VERSION           | INSTALLATION GUIDE |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| {feature name / Glue API name} | {feature version} | {installation guide link} |

### 1) Install the required modules
<!--Provide one or more console commands with the exact latest version numbers of all required modules. If the Composer command contains the modules that are not related to the current feature, move them to the [prerequisites](#prerequisites).-->

<!--When "composer require" includes a "Spryker Feature" (github.com/spryker-feature), then it always needs to be "dev-master" version. For regular modules, use regular versions.-->

```bash
{commands to install the required modules}
```

**Verification**
<!--Describe how a developer can check they have completed the step correctly.-->

<!--Each step needs verification to make sure that the customer did not skip anything unintentionally.
The verification needs to cover the entire "step".
The verification step often needs to use an example domain, use
 - "mysprykershop.com"
 - "zed.mysprykershop.com"
 - "glue.mysprykershop.com"
domains according to your requirements.-->

Make sure the following modules have been installed:

| MODULE       | EXPECTED DIRECTORY <!--for public Demo Shops--> |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| {ModuleName} | {expected directory}                            |

### Set up the configuration
<!--Describe system and module configuration changes. If the default configuration is enough for a primary behavior, skip this step.-->

<!--Only define those configs which have to be overridden / defined by the customer. Configs that are working out of the box, should not be listed.-->

<!--Conventions:
* The "prerequisites" column in the installation guide tables can define behavioral requirements (fulfilled by any "specification" column).
* The "specification" column has to describe what is the behavior of the widget so that the customer can understand it.
* The "specification" column has to describe what is the behavior of the controller so that the customer can understand it.
-->

Add the following configuration:

| CONFIGURATION   | SPECIFICATION   | NAMESPACE   |
| --------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| {configuration} | {specification} | {namespace} |

```php
{code sample with the updated configuration}
```

{% info_block warningBox "Verification" %}

<!--Describe how a developer can check they have completed the step correctly.-->
<!--Each step needs verification to make sure that the customer did not skip anything unintentionally.
The verification needs to cover the entire "step".
The verification step often needs to use an example domain, use
 - "mysprykershop.com"
 - "zed.mysprykershop.com"
 - "glue.mysprykershop.com"
domains according to your requirements.-->

{% endinfo_block %}


### Set up database schema and transfer objects
<!--Provide the following with a description before each item:
* Code snippets with DB schema changes.
* Code snippets with transfer schema changes.
* The console command to apply the changes in project and core. -->

Set up database schema and transfer objects as follows:
1. ...
2. ...
...
5. Apply database changes and generate entity and transfer changes:

```bash
console transfer:generate
console propel:install
console transfer:generate
```

**Verification**
<!--Describe how a developer can check they have completed the step correctly.-->

<!--Each step needs verification to make sure that the customer did not skip anything unintentionally.
The verification needs to cover the entire "step".
The verification step often needs to use an example domain, use
 - "mysprykershop.com"
 - "zed.mysprykershop.com"
 - "glue.mysprykershop.com"
domains according to your requirements.-->

Make sure the following changes have been applied by checking your database:

| DATABASE ENTITY | TYPE          | EVENT   |
| --------------- | ------------- | ------- |
| {entity}        | {entity type} | {event} |

Make sure the following changes have been triggered in transfer objects:

| TRANSFER   | TYPE   | EVENT   | PATH   |
| ---------- | ------ | ------- | ------ |
| {transfer} | {type} | {event} | {path} |

### Set up database schema
<!--If the feature has transfer object definition changes, merge the steps as described in [Set up database schema and transfer objects](#set-up-database-schema-and-transfer-objects). Provide code snippets with DB schema changes, describing the changes before each code snippet. Provide the console commands to apply the changes in project and core. -->

Set up database schema as follows:

1. Adjust the schema definition so entity changes trigger events:

| AFFECTED ENTITY   | TRIGGERED EVENTS  |
| ----------------- | ----------------- |
| {affected entity} | {triggered event} |

```xml
{database schema code}
```

2. Apply database changes and generate entity and transfer changes:

```bash
console transfer:generate
console propel:install
console transfer:generate
```

**Verification**
<!--Describe how a developer can check they have completed the step correctly.-->

<!--Each step needs verification to make sure that the customer did not skip anything unintentionally.
The verification needs to cover the entire "step".
The verification step often needs to use an example domain, use
 - "mysprykershop.com"
 - "zed.mysprykershop.com"
 - "glue.mysprykershop.com"
domains according to your requirements.-->

Make sure that following changes have been applied by checking your database:

| DATABASE ENTITY | TYPE   | EVENT   |
| --------------- | ------ | ------- |
| {entity}        | {type} | {event} |

### Set up transfer objects
<!--If the feature has database definition changes, merge the steps as described in [Set up database schema and transfer objects](#set-up-database-schema-and-transfer-objects). Provide code snippet with transfer schema changes, describing the changes before each code snippet. Provide the console commands to apply the changes in project and core.-->

Generate transfers:

```bash
console transfer:generate
```

```

2. Import data:

```bash
console data:import glossary
```
