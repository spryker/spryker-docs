1. General information about changes made to the module. Example: Example: From version 5 we have changed Price module responsibilities: previously it was responsible for handling product price related functionality. This responsibility has now been moved to the new PriceProduct module which handles product prices, while Price module is responsible for generic Spryker Core related functionality. Because of this change of the Price module responsibility, all related modules have also be updated to work with the PriceProduct module.

2. Identification of areas that can cause BC breaks and a step-by-step instruction of what should be done to avoid them. See example [here](https://documentation.spryker.com/module_migration_guides/mg-price.htm). Removed transfers/transfer fields should be announced. >
