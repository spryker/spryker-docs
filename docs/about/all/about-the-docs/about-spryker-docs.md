Spryker docs are your one-stop hub for all the information about Spryker Cloud Commerce OS.

## The source of truth

When it comes to knowledge sharing, we rely on the docs as the main source of truth. Both external and internal users refer to the docs when developing projects, designing [Spryker Safari courses](https://safari.spryker.com/), creating new or customizing the existing functionality.

## Owned by the Spryker community

The expertise in Spryker is shared among the many engineers and entrepreneurs creating all sorts of projects based on Spryker. That's why the docs are open to any type of contribution: from simple bug fixes to sharing how you managed to solve a complex problem or build around an interesting use case.

## What's in the docs

The docs are focused on covering all the functionality that comes with Spryker and how to build projects with that functionality. Because the docs are community-owned, the content adapts to the users' demands. If you don't find the information you are looking for, feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/spryker/spryker-docs/issues) and we will look into covering the topic. Or ask the Spryker community at [CommerceQuest](https://commercequest.space/).
