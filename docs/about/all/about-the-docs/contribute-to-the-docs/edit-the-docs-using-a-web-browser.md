The Spryker documentation is hosted on GitHub, in the [spryker-docs](https://github.com/spryker/spryker-docs) repository. Therefore, to contribute to the Spryker documents, you have to use GitHub. For more information about what GitHub is, see [About Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git).

We write the Spryker documentation using Markdown. If you don't know Markdown yet, check the [GitHub Markdown Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax). For the documentation-specific Markdown elements and HTML syntax used where Markdown is not enough, see [Markdown syntax](/docs/about/all/about-the-docs/style-guide/markdown-syntax.html).
