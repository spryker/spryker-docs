When writing and reviewing documentation at Spryker, we are mostly relying on external style guides.

The goal of our own style guide is to provide guidance for the cases that are specific to Spryker or those not covered by the external style guides.

## Reference hierarchy

Use the following references in this order:

1. Spryker documentation style guide
2. [Google developer documentation style guide](https://developers.google.com/style)
3. [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/)

## Write in a way that makes sense

Spryker is a rapidly evolving product, as well as its documentation. If it makes sense to not follow the guides, go for it. Consider if your approach is better only in your particular case or for the entire documentation. Edit existing and add new guidance to this style guide.
