Spryker is a modular commerce solution hosted in Spryker Cloud (PaaS / Platform-as-a-Service), which runs on TISAX-certified AWS infrastructure (Assessment Level 3). While Spryker itself is not TISAX-certified (as itâ€™s not transferable from vendor to projects), we provide an architectural foundation, technical capabilities, and flexibility that can be used to implement TISAX-aligned projects, particularly in regulated industries such as automotive and mobility.

This document outlines how Sprykerâ€™s PaaS solution can be used by enterprise customers and system integrators when meeting TISAX security objectives is a requirement, and provides practical guidance for Spryker-based projects in light of TISAX VDA ISA requirements. Sprykerâ€™s guidance does not replace a customerâ€™s own evaluation of the applicable requirements or a customerâ€™s compliant implementation on project-level - the responsibility for both lies with the customer.

## What is TISAX?

TISAX (Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange) is an automotive industry-specific information security assessment, based on ISO/IEC 27001, and maintained by the ENX Association. It focuses on the protection of sensitive data - particularly:

- Personal and operational data
- Supplier and prototype information
- Secure data exchange between partners

Each project and/or company must undergo its own assessment, with compliance depending on internal processes, architecture, and hosting setup.

## Key Considerations

ðŸ›  **Spryker cannot transfer TISAX compliance to customers.**  
Due to the flexible, customizable nature of Spryker and the variability in project code and operations, each customer implementation must undergo its own TISAX audit.

However, Spryker uses a TISAX-ready AWS foundation and provides capabilities that can help a customer to meet compliance requirements when used appropriately.

## Sprykerâ€™s Compliance-Enabling Capabilities

| TISAX Requirement Area            | Spryker Feature / Architectural Capability                                                                                            |
|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Secure Hosting Infrastructure    | Spryker Cloud is hosted on AWS, which is [certified under TISAX](https://aws.amazon.com/de/compliance/tisax/) AL3 across relevant regions.                                       |
| Environment Separation           | Supports fully isolated production, staging, testing, and preview environments to protect sensitive or prototype data.                |
| Access Control and RBAC          | Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is built into the Backoffice (Zed) and API authentication.                                           |
| Secure APIs & Data Exchange      | API-first architecture with token-based authentication, encryption in transit (TLS), and fine-grained access scopes.                  |
| Modular and Auditable Architecture | Code and features are modularized by business domain, simplifying the implementation of least-privilege and audit logging strategies. |
| DevSecOps and CI/CD Compatibility | Supports integration with secure CI/CD practices, including secret management, audit logging, and code scanning tools.                |
| Encryption Support               | Encryption at rest and in transit is supported via AWS services (S3, RDS, etc.).                                                      |
| Custom Security Enhancements     | Customers can implement prototype protection, NDA management, and data classification tagging based on project needs.                 |

## Steps to Achieve TISAX Alignment on Spryker

1. **Define Scope and Target Assessment Level**  
   Identify whether your project will handle sensitive supplier data, prototypes, or vehicle configurations (often triggers TISAX Level 3 requirements).

2. **Choose TISAX-Certified Hosting**  
   Deploy on Spryker Cloud in a TISAX-certified AWS region.

3. **Design Architecture with Isolation & Access Control**  
   Use Sprykerâ€™s environment separation, RBAC, and API scopes to minimize data access and enforce protection boundaries.

4. **Secure Development and Customization**  
   Ensure that any partner or internal development follows secure coding guidelines, includes code reviews, and avoids sensitive data in non-production environments.

5. **Implement Logging & Monitoring**  
   Extend Sprykerâ€™s default logging to cover key user actions, especially in Backoffice, APIs, and data exports. Consider integrating a SIEM.

6. **Document and Audit**  
   Maintain documentation on your technical setup, access controls, risk assessments, and processes to prepare for the TISAX audit.

## Limitations & Disclaimer

Spryker does not provide TISAX certification out of the box and is not responsible for TISAX compliance for individual customer projects.  
Spryker uses TISAX-aligned architectures through certified AWS infrastructure and secure platform features. Customers are responsible for ensuring full alignment, documentation, and audit-readiness based on their own organizational practices.
