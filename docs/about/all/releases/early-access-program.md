The Early Access Program enables real-world testing of our product's new capabilities and tools. This helps us refine and improve the product based on feedback from partners and customers.

Early access release capabilities may be unsupported and are subject to change, potentially leading to changes or discontinuation before a general availability release.

### Participate

You can start participating by using the capability and providing feedback.

### Provide feedback

You can provide feedback through surveys, interviews, and [Feedback Exchange Portal](https://forms.gle/YoKXZsvdS6z5smcm6).

### Iteration and improvement

Based on your feedback, we will continuously improve our capabilities.

### Program shutdown activities

We will announce the program shutdown two weeks in advance. After that, we will transition the tool to a General Availability Release, or discontinue it based on our analysis. Regardless of the outcome, we will communicate the next steps, learnings, and insights from the program.
