With Enhanced Click&Collect, your customers now have the flexibility to choose between delivery and pickup during checkout, enhancing their shopping experience. Store operators also benefit from advanced configuration capabilities for their in-store stock.

Click&Collect includes the following features:

- Service points: Service points broaden the scope of services you can offer at your physical locations beyond order collection. Its adaptable framework simplifies implementing features such as return services and appointment scheduling, allowing businesses to tailor solutions to their specific needs.
- Integrated shipment types at checkout: Provide your customers with the flexibility to choose between delivery and pickup during checkout. With the flexible architecture of the Enhanced Click&Collect, you can create custom shipment types, like "Ship-from-Store", on the project level.
- Works seamlessly with multi-address checkout: Lets your customers divide their orders for different delivery methods. For example, they can have some items delivered to their doorstep while they pick up other items at a location they select.
- Merchant Portal integration: As a store operator, you can now do the following:
    - Specify product availability based on different service points: physical retail outlets, warehouses, or any other pickup location.
    - Adjust stock availability for each service point.
    - Offer varied pricing for items based on their pickup or delivery location.


![click-and-collect-demo](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/releases/release-notes/release-notes-202311.0/click-and-collect.gif)

**Business benefits**:<br>
Enhanced Click&Collect facilitates immediate product availability, offering both B2B and B2C clients the convenience of bypassing wait times associated with shipping. This feature not only significantly reduces or eliminates shipping costs but also provides an opportunity for immediate product inspection, ensuring quality and specifications meet the client's standards. Moreover, it seamlessly blends the digital shopping experience with the tangible benefits of a physical store, fostering direct customer-business interactions and potentially driving additional in-store purchases.

While pickup has its roots in B2C operations, its utility in B2B contexts is growing:
- Automotive industry: Manufacturers and dealers can offer customers the convenience of ordering parts online with the option for on-site installation.
- Manufacturing sector: Streamline operations by letting clients directly retrieve bulk orders from warehouses, enhancing the efficiency of the procurement process.

{% info_block warningBox "Improved version of Dynatrace" %}

We're going to release a refactored version of the Dynatrace integration. This version will be more robust and future-proof. For most projects, we recommend waiting for the new version.

{% endinfo_block %}

We are delighted to announce our newest integration - Dynatrace with Log Forwarding and Metrics Streaming from Spryker PaaS+! This integration is a key step in our journey to support more monitoring platforms compatible with Open Telemetry.

This integration significantly enhances our current monitoring capabilities by extending the coverage of metrics and logs across crucial services such as Amazon ECS, RDS, OpenSearch Service, ElastiCache (Redis), PHP Exceptions, and RabbitMQ. Previously, the scope of these services was more limited, but with this enhancement, a broader and more precise range of metrics for tracking, debugging, and optimization is achieved. These monitoring improvements will also be available in New Relic and CloudWatch at no additional cost.

This feature is ideal for customer DevOps/SREs seeking enhanced, flexible monitoring solutions.

**Business benefits**:<br>
Until now, New Relic was the sole option for aggregating logs and metrics. This integration offers customers the flexibility to connect and integrate their Dynatrace account to Spryker PaaS+, thus enhancing observability and cloud extensibility.

Key features of this integration include the following:

- Log forwarding: Facilitates forwarding of logs from Spryker Cloud services to Dynatrace, covering services like Amazon RDS, ECS, Redis, RabbitMQ, and OpenSearch.
- Metric streaming: Streams performance metrics like CPU usage, memory, network latency, and error rates to Dynatrace, offering real-time insights.
- Unified Observability Platform: Offers a centralized platform for all monitoring needs, compatible with various third-party platforms.
- Efficient data processing: Ensures immediate forwarding of logs and metrics, with frequent data transmission for up-to-date monitoring.
- Spryker support 24/7: Designed to work seamlessly with existing monitoring solutions, Spryker will keep watching over for you 24/7, regardless of the monitoring platform you use.
- Scalability and adaptability: Can handle varying data volumes and peaks, with 24 hours of retention in case of unavailability.

### Technical prerequisites:
- Only available for Spryker Cloud customers.
- You need a self-managed Dynatrace account, and you have to provide the necessary Endpoints to Spryker.
