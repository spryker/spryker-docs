## Stripe app <span class="inline-img">![feature](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/releases/release-notes/feature.png)</span>

With its global reach and adherence to regulatory standards, it ensures hassle-free electronic transactions while meeting compliance requirements.

Currently, Stripe app supports B2C and B2B modes. We are working on enabling Stripe for marketplace models, which offers easy merchant onboarding and management of the payouts from one application.


### Business benefits

## Merchant B2B Contracts & Contract Requests <span class="inline-img">![feature](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/releases/release-notes/feature.png)</span>

In a B2B business model, the partnership is usually based on contracts, or relations, between buyers and merchants. The Merchant B2B Contracts & Contract Requests feature introduces the initiation and management of relation requests, making it easier to connect both parties and to create buyer-merchant relations in B2B marketplaces and shops. These relations enable merchants and marketplace operators to specify buyer-specific products, prices, and order thresholds.

### Business benefits

- Streamlined user journey: Enhance user satisfaction by simplifying the process for buyers to connect with merchants, creating a more seamless and user-friendly experience.
- Efficient operational management: Increase operational efficiency for merchants and marketplace operators by automating the initiation and management of merchant relation requests, which reduces the manual efforts required to establish these relations.

## Data Exchange API <span class="inline-img">![improvement](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/releases/release-notes/improvement.png)</span>

Traditionally, developing APIs required technical expertise and time-consuming coding processes. We removed complexities from the infrastructure of our innovative dynamic Data Exchange API, making creating APIs effortless. With this tool, you can quickly build, customize, and manage APIs tailored to your specific business requirements, all through an intuitive user interface.

In this release, we added the support of CRUD for combined entities allowing to write, read, and update not a single entity, but also other entities connected to it. For example, now you can import a product and all its variants with a single API call. This improves performance and simplifies the implementation of the data import process.

### Business benefits

* Faster data imports
* Friendlier API interface to import data into Spryker

## Symfony 6.4 LTS support <span class="inline-img">![improvement](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/releases/release-notes/improvement.png)</span>

Spryker now supports Symfony 6.4, a long-term support (LTS) version. LTS versions of frameworks provide sustained reliability and security for your applications. Symfony 6.4 provides various enhancements, such as a new Profiler feature, developer experience improvements, including better handling of server params and enhanced HTTP client functionality.

All Spryker products now require Symfony 6.4 or 5.4. We highly recommend migrating to the latest LTS version of Symfony.

As a follow-up of migration to Symfony 6.4, we migrated all critical security modules to the latest version:
- symfony/security-guard
- symfony/security-http
- symfony/security-core

### Business benefit

The latest Symfony framework LTS version provides enhanced stability, security, and performance.

### Documentation

* [Upgrade to Symfony 6](https://docs.spryker.com/docs/dg/dev/upgrade-and-migrate/upgrade-to-symfony-6.html)
* [Symfony blog posts related to new features](https://symfony.com/blog/category/living-on-the-edge/7.0-6.4)

### Technical prerequisites

Upgrade spryker/symfony modules to the latest version by following [Upgrade to Symfony 6](https://docs.spryker.com/docs/dg/dev/upgrade-and-migrate/upgrade-to-symfony-6.html) or running [Spryker Code Upgrader](https://docs.spryker.com/docs/ca/devscu/spryker-code-upgrader.html).
