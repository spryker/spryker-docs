Back Office users can now view all relevant merchant information at a glance without entering the edit mode. Merchant details are consolidated into one comprehensive page, streamlining the process of accessing and reviewing merchant data.

![view-merchant-page](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/About/Releases/release-notes-202410.0.md/view-merchant-page.png)

### Business benefits
* Simplifies data review processes by consolidating key merchant information in a single, non-editable page.
* Eliminates accidental changes when viewing merchant information.


## Back Office accessibility improvements <span class="inline-img">![improvement](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/releases/release-notes/improvement.png)</span>

Back Office is now more accessible to everyone, enabling all types of users to interact and navigate the system. We have implemented the following accessibility improvements:

* Navigation: Users can navigate drawer content and content behind drawers using the **Tab** key.
* Keyboard control: Users can interact with form elements and links using the keyboard.
* Colors and contrast: Improved color contrast and added text as an alternative source of information besides color.




## Improved management of user roles in the Back Office <span class="inline-img">![improvement](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/releases/release-notes/improvement.png)</span>

Back Office areas and actions are now predefined. When managing access of user roles, you can select areas and actions instead of manually entering them.

### Business benefits
* Simplifies the management of user access.
* Reduces the risk of errors when providing and restricting access.



## Publish and Synchronize configuration and optimization <span class="inline-img">![improvement](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/releases/release-notes/improvement.png)</span>

Publish and Sync (P\&S) process has been improved as follows:

- Performance optimization through direct sync: Synchronization queues can be enabled and disabled on the project level. When disabled, synchronization proceeds directly to the synchronize step without intermediate queuing, resulting in faster and more streamlined system performance.   
- Custom queue chunk size configuration: Developers can define custom message chunk sizes per queue. This allows for fine-tuned control over how many messages are processed per queue, like publishing, synchronization, or data import. The docs provide detailed guidance on when to increase or decrease chunk sizes for improved performance.  
- Improved event logger behavior: The event logger now consumes less resources.  
- System health check notifications for P\&S limits: Provides developers with notifications when processed data is reaching system limits. Notifications are sent in the following cases:  
  - A worker exceeds 75% of its available memory.  
  - Event message size surpasses 256KB: this protects the message broker.  
  - The size of a request during entity publishing exceeds 1MB: this ensures compatibility with persistence capabilities.

### Business benefits

* More fine-tuned control over the system.  
* Optimized performance through flexibility.  
* Processing time reduced.  
* Get more actionable insights into system behavior.  
* Prevent performance issues and system overload by proactively addressing potential bottlenecks.

### Documentation   
* [Publish and Synchronization](/docs/dg/dev/backend-development/data-manipulation/data-publishing/publish-and-synchronization.html)
* [Queue](/docs/dg/dev/backend-development/data-manipulation/queue/queue.html)


## Tech update <span class="inline-img">![improvement](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/releases/release-notes/improvement.png)</span>

The following components have been updated to ensure compatibility with the latest technologies and optimize performance:

- PHP 8.3 is now supported; support for PHP 8.1 is discontinued.  
- Jenkins has been upgraded to the latest LTS version. All new cloud environments are now deployed with this version by default. For local development, the new version of Jenkins requires Docker SDK version 1.61.0 or higher.   
- Improved Jenkins' resource management by adding SWAP memory on the infrastructure level. This addresses memory-related issues causing job failures and instability.  
- The Angular framework has been updated to version 17, providing faster performance and smaller asset sizes for the merchant portal.   
- PHPStan has been upgraded to version 1.10, significantly improving code analysis speed.

### Business benefits

* Reduced security risks  
* Reduced maintenance efforts   
* Scaling and more reliable operation

### Documentation

* [Supported versions of PHP](/docs/dg/dev/supported-versions-of-php.html)
