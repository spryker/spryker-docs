## Order Amendment <span class="inline-img">![feature](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/user/intro-to-spryker/releases/release-notes/feature.png)</span>

The Order Amendment feature enhances the shopping experience by enabling customers to add, update, and remove items from existing orders after placement. This brings flexibility and control to the post-purchase process:
- Flexible price recalculation: Choose between retaining original prices, applying current catalog prices, or defining a custom strategy to suit your business logic.
- Flexible stock recalculation: Allow order edits even if items are deactivated or out of stock by preserving original order stock. Quantity can be adjusted down or increased, up to the combined amount of reserved order stock and current catalog availability.
- Seamless multi-cart experience: Customers can switch between editing an order and shopping in their active cart without losing progress. (Requires [multi-cart](/docs/pbc/all/cart-and-checkout/latest/base-shop/feature-overviews/multiple-carts-feature-overview)
- Preserve original order reference: Maintain consistent tracking and reporting by keeping the original order reference.
