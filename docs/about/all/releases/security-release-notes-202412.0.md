2. In the `Pyz\Client\Permission\PermissionDependencyProvider::getPermissionPlugins()` method, register the following plugins:
* Spryker\Client\CompanyRole\Plugin\Permission\CreateCompanyRolesPermissionPlugin
* Spryker\Client\CompanyRole\Plugin\Permission\DeleteCompanyRolesPermissionPlugin
* Spryker\Client\CompanyRole\Plugin\Permission\EditCompanyRolesPermissionPlugin
* Spryker\Client\CompanyRole\Plugin\Permission\SeeCompanyRolesPermissionPlugin
* Spryker\Client\CompanyUser\Plugin\CompanyUserStatusChangePermissionPlugin

* Spryker\Client\CompanyUser\Plugin\Permission\EditCompanyUsersPermissionPlugin
* Spryker\Shared\CompanyUser\Plugin\AddCompanyUserPermissionPlugin
* Spryker\Shared\CompanyUserInvitation\Plugin\ManageCompanyUserInvitationPermissionPlugin

3. Update the data import file. Make sure to replace `test-company_Admin` with your company admin name. If you have multiple company admins, duplicate the provided permission set per admin.

**data/import/common/common/company_role_permission.csv**
```csv
Spryker_Admin,DeleteCompanyUsersPermissionPlugin,
test-company_Admin,DeleteCompanyUsersPermissionPlugin,
test-company_Admin,AddCompanyUserPermissionPlugin,
test-company_Admin,AddCompanyUserPermissionPlugin,
test-company_Admin,EditCompanyUsersPermissionPlugin,
test-company_Admin,SeeCompanyRolesPermissionPlugin,
test-company_Admin,DeleteCompanyRolesPermissionPlugin,
trial-company_Admin,CreateCompanyRolesPermissionPlugin,
trial-company_Admin,EditCompanyRolesPermissionPlugin,
trial-company_Admin,ManageCompanyUserInvitationPermissionPlugin,
trial-company_Admin,CompanyUserStatusChangePermissionPlugin,
```
{% info_block warningBox %}

This CSV import is only an example and will work exclusively for `test-company_Admin` and `trial-company_Admin`. For a real project, you will need to add these plugins to all company admin accounts, and make sure that a new admin account have those permissions.

{% endinfo_block %}

Alternatively, you can assign permissions directly to customers on the company permission management page.
