An online *Marketplace* is a type of e-commerce business where products or services are sold and fulfilled by multiple sellers (*merchants*). A growing number of large companies are adopting the Marketplace business model to create new revenue streams, differentiate from the competition, get a better ROI, and increase customer loyalty by adding more products or services to their assortment.

The Spryker Marketplace solution supports two major types of marketplace models:

- *Pure Marketplace*: In such a marketplace, third-party merchants sell the products. The Marketplace administrator manages the business process and makes money from commissions.

- *Enterprise Marketplace*: This type of marketplace is an organization with existing e-commerce operations, which lets third-party merchants sell through its platform to enrich offerings and stimulate growth. In such cases, both merchants and a Marketplace administrator act as sellers.

The Spryker Marketplace solution supports both B2C and B2B marketplaces. Besides, Spryker Marketplace is not a separate system. Instead, it's built as a set of extensions on top of Spryker Commerce OS, which makes upgrading to Marketplace straightforward and easy.
