We believe that you can only deliver great support when you are on the same page as your customers. Being transparent about our performance metrics and processes is a necessary step towards that.

## Our performance metrics

### First response time

The time it takes us to respond to an incoming case
Generally, we aim for a first response time of under 1 hour. Our current statistics show that we have consistently reached this goal.

### Case resolution time

The time it takes us to solve a case and confirm its resolution with you
This metric is a bit more difficult, as it depends on many factors. On a high level, we discriminate software, infrastructure, and security issues.

#### Software issues

The first step to tackling issues that might be related to the Spryker Core is reproducing reported issues. We ask you to provide the information necessary for us to reproduce your issue in our test environment. Here you can learn how you can help us in this step and subsequently shorten the time it takes us to reproduce your issue. If we can reproduce your issue, we involve our development and engineering team by creating a Jira Ticket. We report back the Jira Issue Number to you so you can use it as a reference later. Our colleges then thoroughly examine the issue, develop a solution, test the solution, and then release the fix. Once the fix is released, we inform you about it and ask you to confirm whether this has solved the problem for you. Once we have your confirmation, we close your case.
Of course, we strive to complete this process as soon as possible; however, cases greatly vary in complexity. Luckily, you can help us here by providing us with info on how important this issue is for you right now, so we can prioritize better.

#### Infrastructure issues

For our Spryker PaaS offering, infrastructure stability and security are paramount. Subsequently, if you raise an infrastructure issue with us, we deal with it with the highest priority. Upon raising an infrastructure issue, we may ask you clarification questions; however, since the business impact of infrastructure issues is regularly extensive, we often immediately escalate the issue to our DevOps team. Then, our colleagues investigate and solve the issue as soon as possible.
By conducting an initial investigation on your end, you can help us speed up this process even more. Find out, how exactly this can be done here.

#### Security issues

To say that we take security issues seriously would be an understatement. The topic is so important to us, that when you raise a case with us that has a suspected impact on the security of our software or our infrastructure, it's escalated to our senior management and most senior engineering personnel. We believe it's better to deal with quite some false positives than to underestimate only one report. While we cannot guarantee certain resolution times here, you can see from our response that we take your case very seriously. If we discover a genuine security threat, we work with you to resolve it with the highest priority.

### Customer Effort Score (CES) and Customer Satisfaction Score (CSS)
Proven scores that we use to measure your experience with our support.
When we close a case, we send out a case closure notification email. This email contains a link to our feedback portal. Whenever you can,  provide honest feedback. We evaluate every single feedback form that we receive from customers. Your feedback matters to us and has a real impact on our support operations.
Because your time is valuable, include only two questions. For these questions, we use the broadly accepted metrics CES and CSS. For CES, you can rate on a five-point scale, how easy it was to work with us. On the CSS, you can indicate how satisfied you were with your interaction, overall.
If you rate us low, we would like to ask you in a comment, why. Depending on your comment, our team lead might contact you for a follow-up. The feedback we receive is discussed openly in our weekly team meetings.

## Our processes

Our internal processes are designed with speed and reliability in mind. We use a state-of-the-art case management system wired up directly with our internal communication tool to provide the best possible visibility to incoming communication.

From an organization's point of few, we are part of the Customer Success Team. This ensures that we know all the details necessary to help you achieve your goals and knowing what matters to you most.

We are also wired up directly with Software Development and DevOps in Spryker. This direct link ensures that we can escalate things quickly to subject matter experts and react to emergencies without long and complex signal paths.

### Case status
When you open a case with us, you receive notification emails that tell you what the status of your case is.
This table lists these stages that Spryker Support Cases go through and gives an explanation of what happens with your case on each of them.

| STATUS | EXPLANATION |
| --- | --- |
| Received | Your case was successfully created in our case system. Spryker Support Personnel can now pick up your case. |
| Diagnosis | Spryker Support Agent has taken over your case and is evaluating your input. It is common that Support Agents get in contact with you on this stage to clarify open questions. |
| Solution Proposed | Good News! We think that we have a solution for your problem and have communicated that solution to you. We ask you to confirm whether the solution provided is acceptable |
| Closed | You confirmed our solution, or closed the case because we could not get feedback from you.
