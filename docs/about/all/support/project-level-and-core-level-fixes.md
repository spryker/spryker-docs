This document explains the differences between project and core level fixes to problems and bugs.

## Project-level fixes

Sometimes, it's important to react fast and provide an undemocratic solution to an urgent problem. This is where project-level fixes come into place. We use them to solve problems on a project level. If a reported problem is relatively simple but has a high business impact, we sometimes provide a patch. This patch might not run through the normal QA and review processes and has the singular purpose of solving a problem with high business impact as fast as possible and buying the time necessary to provide a proper solution.
We also usually try to avoid project-level fixes where possible, because they do not make Spryker better for everyone and treat symptoms rather than solving the core issue.

## Core-level fixes

While often taking a considerable amount of time, depending on the urgency of a particular issue, core-level fixes undergo rigorous QA processes. These fixes are also reviewed by seasoned Spryker architects before release.

## Summary

Wherever the circumstances allow, we try to provide a core-level fix. If the problem is sufficiently urgent, there might be an option to develop a project-level fix for certain problems; however, this should always be viewed as a temporary solution.
