Like any legal text, Service Level Agreements (SLAs) can be hard to understand for the uninitiated. We strive to keep our SLAs clear and comprehensive, but sometimes it's better to explain some core concepts more verbose.

## What we expect from you
Fulfilling SLA is a two-way street, and we cannot achieve good results without you. The following is what we expect from our customers.

### Keeping Spryker environments up-to-date
We generally expect our customers to keep their Spryker environment up to date. The reason for this is having multiple layers.
We release updates to introduce new features, performance improvements, and security enhancements. Especially the last ones you do not want to miss. We want our customers to have fast, responsive, and more secure shops.
Up-to-date code generally means more stability, better support, and compatibility for third-party applications. If you use the latest versions, it means that you are using the best and most up-to-date version of the code we have to offer. Looking at the motivations to keep up-to-.date listed above, this is not only good for you, but it's good for us too. Working with a project that has recent code means that we have an easier time understanding what is going on. This reduces case resolution time and makes communication between you, Spryker Support, and Development much easier.

### Keep it in English

At Spryker people from around the world work together to provide outstanding products and services. To facilitate communication flow and reduce barriers, we decided to make English our business language. When getting in contact with Spryker Support, we ask you to do the same.

### Report problems in a timely manner
If you discover a problem with Spryker Software, please let us know immediately. Avoid ignoring a problem that you find, or work around it without reporting it to us. Not only would this prevent us from making our software better, but your workaround might not be maintainable and could cause you problems with upgradability or reduce your flexibility sometime in the future.

### Bring the right information
Ensure that every case you open with us includes the information we need to work on it. To learn what info matters most, see [Getting the most out of Spryker Support](/docs/about/all/support/getting-the-most-out-of-spryker-support.html).

### Assess business impact realistically
To make sure that we resolve the right cases first, we need to triage and prioritize. You can help us to do this better if you assess and specify the business impact of your problem appropriately. For a more detailed explanation of what business impact is and how priorities work have a look into this [article](/docs/about/all/support/support-ticket-statuses.html#prioritizing-bug-tickets).

## What you can expect from us

In our SLAs, we guarantee certain [First Response Times](/docs/about/all/support/how-spryker-support-works.html#first-response-time).
You can expect us to react to your cases within the time that is specified in your SLA. While we work to resolve high-priority issues as fast as possible, we do not and cannot guarantee resolution times for the issues you open with us because of the breadth of cases we offer to work on. Guaranteeing resolution times would make it necessary for us to make the definition of the cases we accept stricter, which ultimately will makes it harder and more bureaucratic for you to work with us.

### Infrastructure support
For Spryker customers using our PaaS, we can also support infrastructure-related issues, like fault correction and recovery. Because of the critical nature of infrastructure issues, we generally offer a faster response time on these issues and have built robust processes that ensure that these matters are resolved timely and that we proactively update the customer along the way.

### Software support
All Spryker customers can benefit from the support we offer for our Spryker software. We want the software we develop to be easy to work with and reliable. If defects happen that are reproducible for us in the out-of-the-box (OOTB) Spryker installation, we generally file a bug report and communicate the Jira ticket number, so you can reference it in a later communication. Since software development is a process with many steps, sometimes we provide project-level fixes for you rather than wait for the fix to be implemented in our core product and then ship it to you by an update. We make sure, though, that our other customers can benefit from the improvement your bug report introduced to our product in a timely manner.

## What else can you do to avoid problems?
There is a number of things you can do to avoid problems.

### Keep updated on Spryker

Keeping your Spryker environment up to date is important, but it's equally important to keep your knowledge about what is going on with Spryker updated, too.
Our Spryker Community on [CommerceQuest](https://commercequest.space/), a vibrant forum for people using Spryker, is a perfect platform to use. It is also a place where people come to discuss. We would like to invite every customer to join and contribute actively. Often, you will hear the latest news first there. In addition, our community team also hosts monthly Spryker User Group Meetups in which internal Spryker teams and community members share and discuss the latest developments. See [commercequest.space/events](https://commercequest.space/events/category) for upcoming meetups and other relevant events.

Also, subscribe to our new newsletter (soon to come) and be sure to check out our Technical News Page (soon to come), for the latest important news.

### Enroll in the Spryker Safari
This is a general recommendation that not only can teach you and your team how to build great shops with Spryker Code, but we offer several courses for all kinds of Spryker stakeholders. Currently, we offer developer courses, business courses, and sales courses with other interesting courses currently being developed.

### Learn more about how we work
We are working on being more transparent about how we work internally because we believe it makes working with us easier. To learn about our processes, take a look at the other articles in the Support section of our documentation
