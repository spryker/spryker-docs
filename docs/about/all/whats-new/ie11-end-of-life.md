Microsoft announced that the Internet Explorer 11 (IE11) desktop application would be retired on June 15, 2022, for specific versions of Windows 10. Legacy Internet Explorer-based websites and applications will continue to work with Microsoft Edge’s built-in Internet Explorer mode.

It is time to say goodbye to IE11 for Spryker Yves. We have been preparing for this sunsetting for over five months already, and we believe this is the best way forward for you to give your shoppers the best possible experience.

Since the inception of Yves, browser compatibility has been and continues to be very relevant to our development roadmap and evolution.

## Why have we decided to end IE11 support?

In short, it is important for us that anyone who lands on a Spryker-powered website has the best possible user experience. IE11 does not provide the website visitor with a modern and reliable experience.

For merchants, there’s a race: PCI and related standards will force you to stop accepting old clients, while Microsoft and the whole web industry are trying to get them to update. Merchants will be caught in the middle, with potentially unhappy customers contacting the merchant when they can’t complete their purchases.

Browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and even Microsoft Edge are evolving and continually being updated and improved to match web standards, and this is a good thing. Internet Explorer, on the other hand, is not evolving. Microsoft advises against using this browser as the default browser choice. The Microsoft 365 Apps team is said goodbye to IE11 on August 17, 2021.

## Timeline

We have decided to end IE11 support for Spryker as our next product release, estimated for Q4 2022.

## How should you prepare

If IE11 is not relevant to your browser quota, you can rest assured that you are safe. There is no need to implement anything as the people who visit your platform are not extensively “laggards”, so you can focus on other more priority tasks. On the other hand, if you do have a customer base with a significant percentage of people using IE11, we got you covered. We will provide code snippets to be compatible with polyfills so that they can continue to have the most functionality in their deprecated browsers.
