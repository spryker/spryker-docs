This document describes how to access AWS Management Console as an [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html) user.

We create the requested IAM accounts during the initial setup. If you need to create more accounts create an Infrastructure Change/Access Management Request in the [Support Portal](https://support.spryker.com).

To sign in to the AWS Management Console as an IAM user:

1. In your browser, open the sign-in URL provided by your administrator.
{% info_block infoBox "Sign-in URL" %}

The sign-in URL contains the ID of the account you are signing into. The pattern is `https://{AWS_Account_ID}.signin.aws.amazon.com/console/`. Alternatively, you can sign in at the [general sign-in endpoint](https://console.aws.amazon.com/) by entering the account ID manually.

{% endinfo_block %}

The sign-in page opens with the **Account ID (12 digits) or account alias** field entered automatically.

2. Enter the provided **IAM user name** and **Password**.

3. Select **Sign in**.
This takes you to the AWS Management Console.
