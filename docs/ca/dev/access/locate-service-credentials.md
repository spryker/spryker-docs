This document describes how to locate the credentials for Spryker Cloud Commerce OS services.

You can find the credentials for services in the environment variables for the Zed container in [Elastic Container Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html):

{% info_block infoBox "Environment" %}

We use *spryker-staging* environment as an example. Follow the procedure in the desired environment.

{% endinfo_block %}


1. In the AWS Management Console, go to **Services** > **Elastic Container Service** > **[Clusters](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/eks/home#/clusters)**.
2. Select *spryker-staging*.
3. Select *spryker-zed*.
4. Select the value of *Task definition*.

5. In the Container Definitions section, select **Open** (arrow sign) next to the *zed* container.

The credentials are located in the *Environment Variables* section.
