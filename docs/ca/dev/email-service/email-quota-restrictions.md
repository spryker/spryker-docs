SCCOS production email service has the following quotas:
- Daily sending limit: 50.000 emails.
- Sending limit messages per second: 14.

SCCOS non-production email service has the following quotas:
- Daily sending limit: 200 emails.
- Sending limit messages per second: 1

Recipients of emails need to be individually [verified](/docs/ca/dev/email-service/verify-email-addresses.html) for non-production systems.

Reach out to [Spryker Support](/docs/about/all/support/getting-support.html) if these quotas are insufficient to support your use case.
