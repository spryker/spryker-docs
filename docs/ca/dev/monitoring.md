# Monitoring

Effective monitoring is crucial for maintaining the health and performance of your Spryker applications. This page provides access to resources and integrations that enable comprehensive monitoring through logs and application performance metrics.

## Logs with CloudWatch
CloudWatch offers robust logging capabilities, allowing you to track, store, and analyze logs from your Spryker applications and services. Learn more about [working with Logs](/docs/ca/dev/working-with-logs.md).

## Application Performance Monitoring
Application Performance Monitoring (APM) provides near real-time insights into the performance of your applications, helping you quickly identify and resolve issues. For Spryker customers, APM ensures optimal application health, enhancing the user experience by minimizing downtime and performance bottlenecks.
### Spryker Monitoring Integration (OTel)
Integrate Spryker monitoring data into your preferred APM tool using OpenTelemetry for flexible and comprehensive application performance monitoring. Learn more about [Spryker Monitoring Integration](/docs/ca/dev/spryker-monitoring-integration.md).
