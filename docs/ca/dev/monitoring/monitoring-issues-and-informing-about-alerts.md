Every Spryker cloud environment is monitored by the monitoring systems and a dedicated 24/7 team that ensures that environments run stable. If an issue occurs, this team takes action autonomously and informs you about any further actions needed on their or your side. This document explains how monitoring and alerting works.

## Monitoring metrics

The following alerts are configured by default for all environments.

### Endpoint status

<div class="width-100">

| NAME OF METRIC   | DESCRIPTION  |

## When we contact you

Most alerts we receive are temporary states and aren't a real problem. However, some alert patterns require us to take action. There is a difference between critical issues in production environments and staging or test environments. We focus on critical infrastructure problems in production environments.

If there is an alert, the monitoring team looks for a likely explanation, like a temporary deployment error. If the team needs to take an action, they decide if it requires consent or cooperation from your side. If cooperation or consent is needed, they will contact the responsible person by opening an alert case. If a Solution Partner is responsible, you can track the status of these alert cases and the tickets in the Partner Portal. We update them on a daily basis in the **Case Detail** view under **Ticket Status**.

If it's possible to resolve an issue on our own, we'll do it. In case of a downtime or severe service degradation, we inform you about the incident via a case and a Root Cause Analysis [RCA] report.
