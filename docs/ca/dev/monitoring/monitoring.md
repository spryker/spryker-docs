Effective monitoring is crucial for maintaining the health and performance of your Spryker applications. This page provides access to resources and integrations that enable comprehensive monitoring through logs and application performance metrics.

## Application Performance Monitoring
Application Performance Monitoring (APM) provides near real-time insights into the performance of your applications, helping you quickly identify and resolve issues.


### Spryker Monitoring based on OpenTelemetry
Integrate Spryker monitoring data into your preferred APM tool using OpenTelemetry for flexible and comprehensive application performance monitoring. For more details, see [Spryker Monitoring Integration](/docs/ca/dev/monitoring/spryker-monitoring-integration.html).

### New Relic APM

Use New Relic's powerful APM features to monitor and troubleshoot your applications. For more details, see [New Relic](/docs/dg/dev/integrate-and-configure/configure-services.html#new-relic).

## Logs with CloudWatch
CloudWatch offers robust logging capabilities, allowing you to track, store, and analyze logs from your applications and services. For more information on CloucWatch logs, see [Working with Logs](/docs/ca/dev/monitoring/working-with-logs.html).

## Monitoring issues and informing about alerts
Spryker applications are monitored 24/7 by a dedicated team. To learn how monitoring works and what is monitored, see [Monitoring issues and informing about alerts](/docs/ca/dev/monitoring/monitoring-issues-and-informing-about-alerts.html).
