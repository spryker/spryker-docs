{% info_block warningBox "Don't risk your go-live" %}

The preparation steps listed here are mandatory because they're crucial for the success of your go-live. We strongly encourage you, customer or partner, to complete these steps where applicable because we won't be able to resolve issues related to steps not completed in time. Make sure that your project plan contains the tasks related to the go-live checklist and allocates enough time for their completion.

This document describes how to prepare a Spryker project for going live.

We've divided the preparation into approximate timeframes. Feel free to copy this to your project management software and adjust to your needs. Make sure that all of the following tasks are completed at least one week before going live.

## Eight weeks before go-live

| CLO-12 | Cloud       | Prepare a DNS strategy                                   | Decide how you want customers to access your shop and verify that you control access and can manage the DNS. For example, the domain of your shop is `spryker.com`, but you want customers to access the Storefront at `www.spryker.com`. For details on how to set up DNS, see [Set up DNS](/docs/ca/dev/set-up-dns.html).<br>- Optional: Delegate DNS to Spryker. <br>- Make sure Transport Layer security (TLS) certificates are provisioned. If you delegate DNS to Spryker, TLS certificates for your endpoints are created automatically. If you want us to create TLS certificates for your endpoints but don't want to delegate your DNS, request the verification of DNS records through the [Support Portal](https://support.spryker.com). |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| TES-06 | Testing | Conduct stress and performance tests                   | Test your production environment and assess its performance. Because production environments typically employ horizontal auto-scaling, it's essential to test under expected average and peak loads. These tests enable our team to optimize the environment's vertical scaling in advance, ensuring that it can seamlessly handle the expected loads from the get-go without any potential delays caused by auto-scaling mechanisms. This proactive approach eliminates the need for post-launch adjustments.

| CLO-15 | Cloud  | Configure email.            | Configure email boxes and DMARC policy.
| GEN-03 | General  | Implement code freeze                         | We recommend having a code freeze at least two weeks before going live.
| GEN-04 | General  | Evaluate go-live date and preceding tasks | If any of the preceding tasks aren't complete, postpone your go-live or discuss with us how to complete them in time. DNS changes are especially sensitive to deadlines. Because of the way the DNS system works, any DNS changes take time to take effect.
| GEN-05 | General  | Set up third-party systems in production mode      | Make sure that the third-party systems have been switched to the production mode: Set up production configuration for all the third-party systems (in environment variables). Make sure not to expose secrets in the codebase.
| GEN-06 | General  | Set up BI and analytics tools in production mode     | BI and analytics integrations should not be connected to your production database but rather to the provided read replica. Make sure no external system is interacting with your production database.
| GEN-07 | General  | Establish a go-live support team                  | Establish a team that can monitor your go-live process, react quickly to any issues, and work with the Spryker Support or Operations teams.
| GEN-8  | General  | Define the exact plan for the go-live day         | Define the time of deployment. Define the exact steps to be performed, including running Jenkins or other scripts, if needed. Prepare a go-live communication plan: Develop a communication plan to inform stakeholders, customers, and support teams about the launch date and any changes or updates.
| TES-11 | Testing  | Perform end-to-end testing on production          | Test the customer journey with all the third-party systems switched to the production mode. Make sure to cover all important flows: <br>- Customer registration, account management <br>- Main e-commerce flow: search, navigation, checkout, and OMS process <br>- Back Office and Merchant user flows
| DAT-02 | Data     | Remove demo data                                  | Remove all the demo data from the environment. The project should only use the real data that will be used after the go-live. Remove all the demo data that comes with the Spryker repository, which includes demo and admin users. Demo users in a live shop pose a significant security risk for your project.
| DAT-03 | Data     | Import real data                                  | Import real data to the production environment:<br>- Categories<br>- Product data, such as prices, offers, or attributes<br>- Customers, companies, users, merchants<br>- Taxes<br>- Discounts<br>- CMS pages: homepage, CSM blocks, terms & conditions<br>- Custom data<br>- Other data | Criteria: user journeys are running as expected. There're no blockers or unaddressed high-priority bugs. All the test cases and checklists prepared beforehand pass or don't block the release.
