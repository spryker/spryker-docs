{% info_block warningBox "Don't risk your go-live" %}

The preparation steps listed here are mandatory because they're crucial for the success of your go-live. We strongly encourage you to complete these steps where applicable because we won't be able to resolve issues related to steps not completed in time. Make sure that your project plan contains the tasks related to the go-live checklist and allocates enough time for their completion.

This document describes how to prepare a Spryker project for going live.

We've divided the preparation into approximate timeframes, and you can adjust them to your needs. Make sure that all of the following tasks are completed at least one week before going live.

## Eight weeks before go-live

| CLO-12 | Cloud       | Prepare a DNS strategy                                   | Decide how you want customers to access your shop and verify that you control access and can manage the DNS. For example, the domain of your shop is `spryker.com`, but you want customers to access the Storefront at `www.spryker.com`. For details on how to set up DNS, see [Set up DNS](/docs/ca/dev/set-up-dns.html).<br>- Optional: Delegate DNS. To find out how to delegate a DNS name, see [Setting up a custom SSL certificate](/docs/ca/dev/setting-up-a-custom-ssl-certificate.html).<br>- Make sure Transport Layer security (TLS) certificates are provisioned. If you delegate DNS to Spryker, TLS certificates for your endpoints are created automatically. If you want us to create TLS certificates for your endpoints but don't want to delegate your DNS, request the verification of DNS records through the [Support Portal](https://support.spryker.com). If you don't delegate your DNS and want to use your own certificates, provide them to us as described in [Setting up a custom SSL certificate](/docs/ca/dev/setting-up-a-custom-ssl-certificate.html). |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| CLO-13 | Cloud       | Decide Email sending handling                          | Decide how email sending should be handled. If you want to send emails using Spryker, decide whether you want to use the native mail service shipped with Spryker Cloud Commerce OS or integrate a third-party one. If you want to use the native one, let us know the email address that you want to send emails from. We will lift sending restrictions and help you validate the needed DNS name. For more information about the default email service and its restrictions, see [Email service](/docs/ca/dev/email-service/email-service.html).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Also, test the functionality of payment integrations that use call-backs or depend on API calls to your application in your production environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Criteria: <br>- Make sure the headers of all API requests contain the production mode information to avoid security issues. <br>- Thoroughly test payment integrations that rely on external systems, such as callbacks or APIs, specifically in production.

| CLO-15 | Cloud  | Configure email.            | Configure email boxes and DMARC policy.
| GEN-03 | General  | Implement code freeze                         | We recommend having a code freeze at least two weeks before going live.
| GEN-04 | General  | Evaluate go-live date and preceding tasks | If any of the preceding tasks aren't complete, postpone your go-live or discuss with us how to complete them in time. DNS changes are especially sensitive to deadlines. Because of the way the DNS system works, any DNS changes take time to take effect.
| GEN-05 | General  | Set up third-party systems in production mode      | Make sure that the third-party systems have been switched to the production mode: Set up production configuration for all the third-party systems (in environment variables). Make sure not to expose secrets in the codebase.
| GEN-06 | General  | Set up BI and analytics tools in production mode     | BI and analytics integrations should not be connected to your production database but rather to the provided read replica. Make sure no external system is interacting with your production database.
| GEN-07 | General  | Establish a go-live support team                  | Establish a team that can monitor your go-live process, react quickly to any issues, and work with the Spryker Support or Operations teams.
| GEN-8  | General  | Define the exact plan for the go-live day         | Define the time of deployment. Define the exact steps to be performed, including running Jenkins or other scripts, if needed. Prepare a go-live communication plan: Develop a communication plan to inform stakeholders, customers, and support teams about the launch date and any changes or updates.
| TES-11 | Testing  | Perform end-to-end testing on production          | Test the customer journey with all the third-party systems switched to the production mode. Make sure to cover all important flows: <br>- Customer registration, account management <br>- Main e-commerce flow: search, navigation, checkout, and OMS process <br>- Back Office and Merchant user flows
| DAT-02 | Data     | Remove demo data                                  | Remove all the demo data from the environment. The project should only use the real data that will be used after the go-live. Remove all the demo data that comes with the Spryker repository, which includes demo and admin users. Demo users in a live shop pose a significant security risk for your project.
