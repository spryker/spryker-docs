This document describes how to check ECR image scan results.

After a new code is pushed to a repository, ECR scans images for known vulnerabilities. You can check scan results and resolve detected issues to protect your applications. See [Image scanning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/image-scanning.html) to learn more about ECR image scans.

To check image scan results:

1. In the AWS Management Console, go to **Services** > [Elastic Container Registry](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ecr/repositories).
2. From the navigation bar, select the region the desired repository is located in.
3. In the navigation pane, select **Repositories**.
4. On the *Repositories* page, select the repository that contains the image whose scan you want to check.
5. In the *Vulnerabilities* column of the *Images* page, select **Details** next to the image whose scan you want to check.

You've located ECR image scan results.
