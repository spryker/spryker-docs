This document describes the aspects to consider while preparing and conducting a penetration test.

## General considerations

Penetration tests are an integral part of improving the security of your application. We strongly encourage our customers and partners to conduct penetration tests, especially during go-live preparations and after major updates or project milestones.

## Preparation for a penetration test

Let us know about your plans to run a penetration test by reaching out to secops@spryker.com and by completing the [Penetration Test Request Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfunn1HY-nsqueP6sRQSLmScUWlmmQyQJk9cscIVIP_5BmuOw/viewform). Make sure to provide at least a seven working days’ notice. Take into account the [AWS Penetration Testing Policy](https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/), which outlines prohibited activities.
