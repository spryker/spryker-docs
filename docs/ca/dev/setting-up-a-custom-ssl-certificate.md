This document describes how to set up an SSL certificate (SSL) for a production environment.

By default, all the domain names (domains) are provided with generic SSLs, which are managed automatically. For the production environment, you can set up a custom SSL certificate.

{% info_block infoBox "Third-party DNS zone provider" %}

If the DNS zone of a domain name is hosted with a third-party provider, it's impossible to use the generic SSLs and manage custom SSLs in Spryker Cloud Commerce OS.

{% endinfo_block %}

{% info_block warningBox "Pre-installed SSLs" %}

If you provided custom SSLs for the initial setup, they are already installed and you can skip this step.

{% endinfo_block %}


## Setting up a custom SSL certificate

To set up a custom SSL:

1. Register an SSL.
2. Provide the following details via [support](https://support.spryker.com):
    * Domain name
    * Certificate body
    * Certificate private key
    * Optional: Certificate chain

{% info_block warningBox "Format" %}

The values should be [PEM-encoded](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/import-certificate-format.html).

{% endinfo_block %}

We set up the SSL shortly after you have provided it.
