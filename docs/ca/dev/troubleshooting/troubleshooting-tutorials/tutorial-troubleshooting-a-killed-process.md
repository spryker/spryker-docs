One of the reasons for a process being killed is OOM Killer(Out of memory Killer).

The OOM Killer is a process that the Linux kernel employs when the system is critically low on memory. This happens when the Linux kernel over-allocates memory to its processes.  

If the primary container process was killed by OOM Killer, the container exit status is `139`. To check the exit status of a process, do the following:
