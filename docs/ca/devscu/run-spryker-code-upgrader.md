Spryker Code Upgrader runs automatically based on the [configured schedule](/docs/ca/devscu/configure-spryker-code-upgrader.html).

To manually trigger the Upgrader, follow the steps:

1. In the Upgrader UI, go to **Projects**.
2. On the **Projects** page, select **Spryker Code Upgrader**.
    This opens the **Pipelines** page.
3. Next to the **Upgrader** pipeline, click **Run**.
    This manually triggers the Upgrader. It analyzes the connected project and creates a PR with updates.
