If you are connecting the Upgrader to your repository using an access token, the token should have the correct rights.

## Error

```shell
TransportException: Cannot move pack to ...
```

## Solution

1. Double-check the permissions of the access token based on the requirements:

* [GitHub access token requirements](/docs/ca/devscu/connect-spryker-code-upgrader/connect-spryker-code-upgrader-to-a-gitlab-managed-project.html#prerequisites)
* [GitLab access token requirements](/docs/ca/devscu/connect-spryker-code-upgrader/connect-spryker-code-upgrader-to-a-gitlab-managed-project.html#prerequisites)
* [GitLab access token requirements for self-hosted projects](/docs/ca/devscu/connect-spryker-code-upgrader/connect-spryker-code-upgrader-to-a-project-self-hosted-with-gitlab.html#prerequisites)
* [Azure access token requirements](/docs/ca/devscu/connect-spryker-code-upgrader/connect-spryker-code-upgrader-to-an-azure-managed-project.html#prerequisites)

2. If the permissions are correct, reconnect the repository.
