To prevent unauthorized access to the App Catalog and its configurations, we recommend to limit access to it by implementing user roles. Configure your project to designate an admin user with access to the App Catalog page. For everyone else, hide the `/app-catalog-gui/`page by assigning specific user roles. For detailed instructions on creating and managing user roles, see [Best practices: Manage users and their permissions with roles and groups](/docs/pbc/all/user-management/{{site.version}}/base-shop/manage-in-the-back-office/best-practices-manage-users-and-their-permissions-with-roles-and-groups.html).
