The following diagram explains the configuration and disconnect flows for a payment app.

![configure-and-disconnect-flow](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/dg/dev/acp/apis-and-overview-diagrams-for-payment-service-providers.md/configure-and-disconnect-flows.png)

Optional messages:
- `AddPaymentMethod`
- `UpdatePaymentMethod`
- `DeletePaymentMethod`
- `ReadyForMerchantAppOnboarding`

The Payment Method related messages are used to manage payment methods in Spryker. These messages are sent only when a payment method configuration changes or when the list of available payment methods changes.

The `ReadyForMerchantAppOnboarding` message is used to inform Spryker that the app is ready to onboard merchants; used only for marketplace projects.
