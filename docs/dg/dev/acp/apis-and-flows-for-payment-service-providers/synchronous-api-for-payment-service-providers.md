All PSP integrations are based on a synchronous API. A synchronous API is used to process payments and transfers to merchants. The following endpoints are used:

- `/configure`: Used from the ACP app catalog to configure an app.
- `/disconnect`: Used from the ACP app catalog to disconnect an app.
- `/initialize-payment`: Used from the Spryker backend after an order was created and before the hosted payment page is shown to the customer. Initializes the payment in the PSP app, and the PSP app returns the URL to the hosted payment page.
- `/payments`: Glue API endpoint to initialize a payment.
- `/payment-cancellations`: Glue API endpoint to cancel a previously created payment.
- `/confirm-pre-order-payment`: Used from the Spryker backend after an order was created using a headless approach where the payment gets created before the order persists. This connects a previously created (preOrder) payment on the app side with the order on the Zed side.
- `/cancel-pre-order-payment`: Used from the Glue API application in a headless approach when a customer clicks cancel or in case the headless implementation requires a cancellation. This cancels the payment on the PSP side.
- `/payments/transfers`: Used from the Back Office or OMS with the app being used in a marketplace. This initiates a money transfer from the marketplace to the merchant.
- `/webhooks`: Used from external applications to send requests to an app.
- `/webhooks/test`: Used from external applications in test mode to send requests to an app.
