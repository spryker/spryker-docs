## ACP components

ACP consists of the following components:
* App catalog: The interface for managing all ACP apps. The App catalog provides details about an integration, enables users connect to the ACP and add configurations to connect to a third-party app. It can be accessed via the Spryker Back Office. You can view the read-only version of the ACP Catalog in the [Spryker Product Portal](https://product.spryker.com/features/acp/acp-catalog/#/catalog).
*  App Composition Platform and infrastructure: The underlying platform for the ACP facilitates defining how Spryker projects communicate with third-party integrations via the ACP.
*  ACP apps: Integrations provided by Spryker by default via the ACP. Spryker offers a range of zero to low-code applications.

## Installing the ACP Catalog

The ACP Catalog in the Back Office is available since version **202212.0**.

To run ACP Catalog with an earlier version, install the `spryker/app-catalog-gui` module version `1.4.1` or higher.
