## Introduction

Welcome to Spryker's Early Access Program where we value your feedback while our features are still under development. This guide will help you navigate through the program, understand the scope, provide feedback, and ultimately help us refine and improve our product.

## GPT: Spryker Cypress E2E Assistant

The Spryker Cypress E2E Assistant, powered by GPT technology, is specifically designed to help developers and QA engineers implement, configure, and optimize Cypress for end-to-end (E2E) testing in Spryker projects. The assistant leverages a knowledge base containing the Spryker Cypress Boilerplate repository and other assets to provide accurate, example-driven guidance, ensuring best practices and optimized testing workflows.

### Use Case

*User Profile*: Anna is a QA engineer at an e-commerce company that uses Spryker's B2B marketplace. She is responsible for maintaining the quality of the platform by writing and running Cypress tests to ensure smooth functionality after every deployment.
*Problem*: Anna needs a comprehensive tool to assist her in writing Cypress tests, integrating them into the continuous integration (CI) pipelines, and maintaining consistency in testing structures and best practices.

### Solution with the Spryker Cypress E2E Assistant

1. *Understanding E2E Testing*: The assistant helps Anna understand the fundamentals of E2E testing, why it's crucial in ensuring system reliability, and how to determine what to cover with E2E tests to ensure comprehensive test coverage for critical user flows.
2. *Best Practices*: The assistant provides Anna with best practices for maintaining consistent, efficient Cypress tests, including recommendations on structuring tests, writing reusable custom commands, and ensuring scalability of tests as the project grows.
3. *Step-by-Step Guidance*: Anna uses the assistant to get detailed, step-by-step instructions on setting up Cypress and integrating it into her Spryker environment. The assistant provides direct guidance from the Spryker Cypress Boilerplate, helping her configure test structures and execute tests efficiently.
4. *Code Snippet Assistance*: Anna can request specific Cypress test examples and receive accurate, ready-to-use real-world snippets from the Spryker Cypress Boilerplate repository.

## Program Goals

We aim to:
1. *Integration and Compatibility Testing*: The goal here is to evaluate how well the Spryker Cypress E2E Assistant integrates into various Spryker projects. We want to assess the ease with which engineers can use this tool to integrate Cypress E2E tests within their projects.
2. *Identify Gaps and Issues*: Since this is a third-party tool using another third-party tool, Spryker is not in control of how ChatGPT behaves. So there may be unexpected issues and unsatisfactory results which we need to track and collect to understand if they can be improved upon.
3. *Understand User Onboarding and Learning Curve*: We need to evaluate if this tool can be successfully used by engineers with varying levels of expertise. This includes assessing whether they can effectively utilize the tool without extensive training and derive valuable insights for their testing processes.
4. *Drive Adoption*: By offering early access to the Spryker Cypress E2E Assistant, the program aims to drive adoption among engineers. Promote usage of the assistant to help engineers streamline their testing process, particularly in writing and managing Cypress tests within Spryker environments.
5. *Gather Case Studies and Success Stories*: For marketing and promotional purposes, the program should aim to gather case studies and success stories of early users who have derived significant value from the tool. This would be useful in promoting the tool during its full launch.

Your feedback will help us understand if we are meeting these goals effectively.
