## Introduction

Welcome to Spryker's Early Access Program where we value your feedback while our features are still under development. This guide will help you navigate through the program, understand the scope, provide feedback, and ultimately help us refine and improve our product.

## GPT: Spryker DevQA Assistant

The Spryker DevQA Assistant, powered by GPT technology, is tailored to assist Spryker developers in DevQA tasks by providing comprehensive QA checklists and insights into feature/module mappings and dependencies. This tool is designed to streamline the functional testing process, ensuring that changes and updates are thoroughly tested to maintain the integrity of the Spryker system.

### Use Case

*User Profile*: John is a QA engineer at a mid-sized retail company that uses Spryker for their e-commerce platform. He is responsible for ensuring that new features and updates do not introduce regressions.

*Problem*: John needs a reliable way to quickly identify all impacted features and modules when a change is made. He also needs detailed functional testing checklists to ensure comprehensive testing.

### Solution with the Spryker DevQA Assistant

1. Guided Support:
    - John uses the Spryker DevQA Assistant to get detailed functional testing checklists based on Spryker features, their child features, module mappings, and dependencies.
    - The assistant determines the impact of new changes in modules or features and offers relevant testing guidance.

2. Comprehensive Knowledge Base:
    - Utilizes an extensive knowledge base of Spryker features, modules, and dependencies.
    - Provides clear, accurate, and detailed information for testing specific features or modules after bug fixes or updates.

3. Dependency Analysis:
    - Cross-checks dependencies between features and modules to understand their relationships and integration.
    - Identifies all affected features or modules due to changes.

4. Access to Official Documentation:

    - Ensures users receive ready-to-use results, considering they may not have access to Spryker's internal knowledge base.

## Program Goals

We aim to:
1. *Integration and Compatibility Testing*: The goal here is to evaluate how well the Spryker DevQA Assistant integrates into various Spryker projects. We want to assess the ease with which engineers can use this tool to generate functional testing checklists and analyze dependencies within their projects.
2. *Identify Gaps and Issues*: Since this is a third-party tool using another third-party tool, Spryker is not in control of how ChatGPT behaves. So there may be unexpected issues and unsatisfactory results which we need to track and collect to understand if they can be improved upon.
3. *Understand User Onboarding and Learning Curve*: We need to evaluate if this tool can be successfully used by engineers with varying levels of expertise. This includes assessing whether they can effectively utilize the tool without extensive training and derive valuable insights for their testing processes.
4. *Drive Adoption*: By offering early access to the Spryker DevQA Assistant, the program aims to drive adoption among engineers. The main goal is to promote the usage of comprehensive functional testing checklists and dependency analysis within Spryker projects, providing an easy entry point for users.
5. *Gather Case Studies and Success Stories*: For marketing and promotional purposes, the program should aim to gather case studies and success stories of early users who have derived significant value from the tool. This would be useful in promoting the tool during its full launch.

Your feedback will help us understand if we are meeting these goals effectively.
