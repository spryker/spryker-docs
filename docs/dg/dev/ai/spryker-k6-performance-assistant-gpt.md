## Introduction

Welcome to Spryker's Early Access Program where we value your feedback while our features are still under development. This guide will help you navigate through the program, understand the scope, provide feedback, and ultimately help us refine and improve our product.

## GPT: Spryker K6 Performance Assistant

### Problem statement

Depending on the use cases, load and business model Spryker shops can have different performance expectations for different projects. It may be cumbersome to design a performance test suite that meets these performance expectations from scratch. It is especially difficult to approach if there is not enough expertise in the team to be able to create performance tests without investing additional time into training and investigation

### Use Case

Let's consider a use case involving a company called 'C&A' which sells clothes and accessories. They have an unstable load on their online shops - there is a considerable difference in number of orders between normal days and the days of the sales, they also provide limited-time offers using coupons which last only for a few hours at a time.

They need to be sure their shop will remain in a good shape and functional during the peak hours (for example during the special offers), but they also need to make sure they are not overpaying for their environments when are operation in the everyday mode. Their operating their shop using Spryker Glue API and want it to be responsive and fast especially as the times of high demand.

'C&A' would benefit from the use of Spryker K6 Performance Assistant. it will provide them with the ability to tailor a set of performance tests to emulate the ebb and raise in the sales. It would allow them to check if their shops are performing according to their expectations in different scenarios. It would also eliminate the need for excessive training or searching for an expertise in performance testing from the very start. Spryker K6 Performance Assistant provides an easy way to start the performance testing of any shop with a very low learning curve and no prior preparation or knowledge about performance testing tools. The tests provided by this assistant can then be expanded as the expertise of the team increases, but this is an easy way to start performance testing from scratch.

## Program Goals

We aim to:
1. *Integration and Compatibility Testing*: The goal here would be to see how well Spryker K6 Performance Assistant can help to create performance tests that are tailored for the specific project NFRs. We want to check how easy it is to integrate performance tests into a project using this tool.
2. *Identify Gaps and Issues*: Since this is a third-party tool using another third-party tool, Spryker is not in control of how ChatGPT behaves. So there may be unexpected issues and unsatisfactory results which we need to track and collect to understand if they can be improved upon.
3. *Understand User Onboarding and Learning Curve*: We need to evaluate if this tool can be successfully used by people and teams with no performance testing expertise or experience without additional training and result in a usable set of performance tests tailored to the project needs.
4. *Drive Adoption*: By offering early access to the tool, the program can start to drive adoption among developers. The main aim is to drive the adoption of the usage of performance tests on project level and this program provides an easy entry point to do that.
5. *Gather Case Studies and Success Stories*: For marketing and promotional purposes, the program should aim to gather case studies and success stories of early users who have derived significant value from the tool. This would be useful in promoting the tool during its full launch.

Your feedback will help us understand if we are meeting these goals effectively.
