One of the main tasks of a commerce platform is the possibility to customize, extend, and integrate it with external services, such as payment providers, order processors, and the like. To provide a clear path for the Spryker Commerce OS development and extension, its architecture is based on strict modularity and separation. These principles are strongly supported by the OS architecture. This architecture guide helps you understand how they are implemented on different levels.

In this section, you can learn the following topics:

* The Spryker architecture and concepts.
* What technologies we use.
* What applications the Spryker Commerce OS is composed of.
* How we enable the development of high-performance applications and their scalability.

Also, this guide is especially useful for developers, architects, and integrators dealing with Spryker Cloud Commerce OS.
