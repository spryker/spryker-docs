Spryker adheres to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) to communicate the stability and expected impact of changes within its modules. As part of this versioning scheme, any module with a version *below 1.0.0* is considered a *zero-major* module.

This document describes what using such a module means for *developers* and *project stakeholders*, focusing on technical expectations, functional completeness, and versioning behavior.

## Zero-major module definition

Zero-major modules are *early-stage implementations* that are publicly released for evaluation and early integration. These modules follow a versioning pattern of `0.x.x` and are not considered stable.

A module remains zero-major until it reaches version *1.0.0*, at which point it is considered **stable** and the full set of [semantic versioning guarantees](https://docs.spryker.com/docs/dg/dev/architecture/module-api/semantic-versioning-major-vs.-minor-vs.-patch-release.html) apply.

## Technical characteristics of zero-major modules

- ❌ Backward compatibility is not guaranteed: breaking changes may occur between `0.x.x` versions and even after reaching `1.0.0`  
- ❌ Migration effort is unpredictable: updates may introduce significant migration requirements  
- ✅ Code doesn't contain any critical bugs that could prevent the functionality from being used according to its business requirements
- ⚠️ Non-functional requirements may be only partially met, such as performance, scalability, and handling of high entity counts  


## Business characteristics

From a business perspective, zero-major modules are *not feature-complete* and *subject to change*. 

- ⚠️ Liability is limited because of Early Access functionality  
- ⚠️ Functional gaps may exist: not all use cases or workflows may be supported
- ❌ Business logic stability is not guaranteed: feature definitions may evolve until version 1.0.0  
- ⚠️ Production readiness requires validation and depends on the specific use case and module maturity  


Business logic and behaviors may be redefined based on feedback, internal alignment, or ongoing development needs.

Early Access functionality is not recommended for use in production environments and is not covered by Spryker's SLAs. These features are typically developed during the R&D phase and are made available primarily for educational and experimental purposes.

## Evaluating module readiness and gaps

The readiness and potential gaps in a zero-major module can vary. To determine if it meets your project's technical and functional needs, align with us to assess the following:

- Which functional and non-functional capabilities are currently supported  
- Limitations or planned changes  

This gives you a solid understanding of the module's maturity and avoids unexpected issues during integration.


## Zero-major module use cases

You might want to use a zero-major module in the following cases:
- ✅ You want early access to upcoming functionality  
- ✅ You're building a PoC or MVP and can tolerate change  
- ✅ You've aligned with us on the module's capabilities and limitations

You should not use a zero-major module in the following cases:
- ❌ You require long-term BC and NFR guarantees
- ❌ You can't afford migration costs in short iterations
