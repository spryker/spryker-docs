The [list of console commands](/docs/dg/dev/backend-development/console-commands/get-the-list-of-console-commands-and-available-options.html) contains the command names together with a short description of what the command does. The most important commands in Spryker can be split into four categories: collector commands, order management system commands, setup commands, and frontend-related commands. This document provides details about each of the commands.

## Collector commands

Collector commands are responsible for exporting the data in the SQL database to the frontend data storages (Redis and Elasticsearch):

* `collector:search:export`—exports data to the Elasticsearch storage.
* `collector:search:update`—updates the data in the Elasticsearch storage.
* `collector:storage:export`—exports data to Key-Value storage (Redis).

## Order Management System commands

Check whether conditions are satisfied for the orders that are in the state that is the source state for the transition that has a condition attached.

```bash
console oms:check-condition
```

Options:

* `-s`, `--store=store`—filters by the given store.
* `-l`, `--limit=limit`—limits the number of orders.

Examples:

```bash
$ console oms:check-condition -s DE
$ console oms:check-condition --limit=100 --store=DE
```

---
Check whether the timeout was reached for the orders that are in the state that is the source state for the transition that has a timeout attached.

```bash
console oms:check-timeout
```

Options:

* `-s`, `--store=store`—filter by the given store
* `-l`, `--limit=limit`—limit the number of orders

Examples:

```bash
$ console oms:check-timeout --store=DE --limit=100
$ console oms:check-timeout -l 100
```

## Installation setup commands

- The following command runs a set of commands necessary for installing or updating the application.

```bash
setup:install
```

  The following steps are performed when running this command:

  1. Delete all cache files for all stores:

  ```bash
  cache:delete-all
  ```

  2. Remove the directory that contains the generated files, such as transfer classes, merged database schema XML files, or autocompletion classes:

  ```bash
  setup:remove-generated-directory
  ```

  3. Create or migrate the database:

  ```bash
  setup:propel
  ```

  4. Generate transfer classes for each of the objects defined in the XML transfer files:

  ```bash
  transfer:generate
  ```

  5. Initialize the database with required data:

  ```bash
  setup:init-db
  ```

  6. Generate IDE auto-completion files to activate navigation to referenced classes. Generated auto-completion classes can be found for each application under the generated folder.

```bash
dev:ide:generate-auto-completion
```

  7. Build the project resources for Yves and Zed.
  8. Build the navigation tree.

  ```bash
  application:build-navigation-tree
  ```

  {% info_block infoBox %}

  Each of the commands contained in the previous steps can also be executed individually.

  {% endinfo_block %}

- Insert demo data into the database for testing reasons.

```bash
setup:install:demo-data
```

- Setup propel command runs a set of commands, necessary for creating or migrating the database.

```bash
setup:propel
```
  The following steps are performed when running this command:

  1. Write propel configuration:

  ```bash
  setup:propel:config:convert
  ```

  2. Create the database if it doesn't exist yet, based on the configuration set in the previous step:

  ```bash
  setup:propel:database:create
  ```

  3. Ensure compatibility with PostgreSQL, if necessary, by adjusting the Propel XML schema files:

  ```bash
  setup:propel:pg-sql-compat
  ```

  4. Copy schema files from Spryker and project packages to the generated folder:

  ```bash
  setup:propel:schema:copy
  ```

  5. Build Propel classes based on the XML schema files:

  ```bash
  setup:propel:model:build
  ```

  6. Compare the propel models with the database tables and generate the diff to prepare for migration:

  ```bash
  setup:propel:diff
  ```

  7. Migrate the database: update the database so that's in sync with the propel models in the project:

  ```bash
  setup:propel:migrate
  ```

## Jenkins setup commands

Cron jobs are scheduled by using Jenkins. For setting up Jenkins, the following console commands can be used from the command line:

* Start the Jenkins service:

```bash
scheduler:resume
```

* Shut down the Jenkins service:

```bash
scheduler:suspend
```

* Set up the cron jobs based on the definitions contained in the configuration file (the config file for jobs is placed in `/config/Zed/cronjobs/jobs.php`):

```bash
scheduler:setup
```

* Clean Jenkins jobs:

```bash
scheduler:clean
```

{% info_block infoBox "Git Commands" %}

Git commands are activated through console commands and they affect the Spryker packages.

{% endinfo_block %}

## Frontend-related commands

Depending on your environment and needs, there is a number of commands you can run. The following table provides an overview of such commands.

{% info_block infoBox %}

To use the npm commands, download and install [Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm). The minimum version for Node.js is *18.x* and for npm it's *9.x*. Then, you can use the appropriate commands listed in the table.
