To create a new custom scheduler, follow these steps:

1. Create a reader plugin that reads the configuration of jobs from the specific source.
2. Create an adapter plugin that covers the basic scheduler functionality.
3. In `\Pyz\Zed\Scheduler\SchedulerDependencyProvider`, enable plugins and adjust configuration settings according to your changes.
