Spryker can automatically generate a UUID column based on row data.
Expose only UUIDs through customer-facing APIs, such as the Storefront API and Glue API.

1. Require the composer dependency:

```shell
composer require spryker/uuid-behavior
```

2. Extend your `<table-name>` Propel model definition with:

```xml
        <column name="uuid" required="false" type="VARCHAR" size="36"/>

        <behavior name="uuid">
            <parameter
                name="key_columns"
                value="<column list, dot-separated, e.g. id_table_name.some_column.another_column>"
        />
        </behavior>
```

The column list must contain columns from the same table, separated by dots (`.`).
The UUID is generated from a string that concatenates the dot-separated values of these columns.
Include the primary key (`id_â€¦`) in the list, because UUID version 5 (UUIDv5) generates the same UUID for the same combined key-column values.

{% info_block warningBox "Prerequisite" %}

Add a `uuid` column of type string with a length of at least 36 characters.
Otherwise, insert operations into this table fail.

{% endinfo_block %}

3. Update the database schema and regenerate PHP models:

```shell
console propel:install
```

4. Verify that the `uuid` column is present in the database table.
Insert a new entity to confirm that UUIDs are generated automatically.

{% info_block infoBox "For tables with existing data" %}

If you are adding the column `uuid` into existing table, please follow [this guide](/docs/pbc/all/cart-and-checkout/latest/base-shop/install-and-upgrade/install-features/install-the-uuid-generation-console-feature#set-up-console-command) to fill daata into existing columns.

{% endinfo_block %}
