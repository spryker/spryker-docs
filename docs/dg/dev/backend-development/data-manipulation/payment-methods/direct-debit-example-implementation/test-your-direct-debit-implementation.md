After the Direct Debit payment method has been set up on the [frontend](/docs/dg/dev/backend-development/data-manipulation/payment-methods/direct-debit-example-implementation/implement-direct-debit-in-yves.html), [backend](/docs/dg/dev/backend-development/data-manipulation/payment-methods/direct-debit-example-implementation/implement-direct-debit-in-zed.html), and [shared implementation](/docs/dg/dev/backend-development/data-manipulation/payment-methods/direct-debit-example-implementation/implement-direct-debit-in-the-shared-layer.html), test it by [submitting a new order](/docs/pbc/all/cart-and-checkout/{{site.version}}/base-shop/feature-overviews/checkout-feature-overview/multi-step-checkout-overview.html) from Yves. Then, you can manage the flow of the order [in the Back Office](/docs/pbc/all/order-management-system/{{site.version}}/base-shop/manage-in-the-back-office/orders/change-the-state-of-order-items.html).
