After completing the instructions on [frontend](/docs/dg/dev/backend-development/data-manipulation/payment-methods/invoice/implement-invoice-payment-in-frontend.html), [backend](/docs/dg/dev/backend-development/data-manipulation/payment-methods/invoice/implement-invoice-payment-in-backend.html)Ð± and [shared](/docs/dg/dev/backend-development/data-manipulation/payment-methods/invoice/implement-invoice-payment-in-frontend.html) implementation, you can test the payment method you just implemented.

This is the last step of this tutorial.
