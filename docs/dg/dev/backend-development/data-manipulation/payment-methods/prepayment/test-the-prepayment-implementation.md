When you have completed the instructions on [frontend](/docs/dg/dev/backend-development/data-manipulation/payment-methods/prepayment/implement-prepayment-in-frontend.html), [backend](/docs/dg/dev/backend-development/data-manipulation/payment-methods/prepayment/implement-prepayment-in-backend.html), and [shared](/docs/dg/dev/backend-development/data-manipulation/payment-methods/prepayment/implement-prepayment-in-shared-layer.html) implementation, you can test the payment method you just implemented.

All you need to do is to submit a new order from Yves. After that, you can control the flow of the order in Zed UI.
