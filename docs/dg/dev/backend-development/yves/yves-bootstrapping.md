Yves and Zed are both built upon the [Symfony components](https://symfony.com/components). So most concepts about modern web frameworks are applied here as well.

In `static/public/Yves/index.php`, you can find the entry for the frontend application.

```php
<?php
Environment::initialize();

$errorHandlerEnvironment = new ErrorHandlerEnvironment();
$errorHandlerEnvironment->initialize();

$bootstrap = new YvesBootstrap();
$bootstrap
    ->boot()
    ->run();
```

The `boot()` method returns an application that has the `run()` method, which processes the request and returns a response to the browser. YvesBootstrap is responsible for building the desired application. The registration process is handled by the `boot()` operation.


## Application plugins

The application uses application plugins that add the required base functionality of your project.

```php
<?php

namespace Pyz\Yves\ShopApplication;
// ...

class ShopApplicationDependencyProvider extends SprykerShopApplicationDependencyProvider
{

    /**
     * @return \Spryker\Shared\ApplicationExtension\Dependency\Plugin\ApplicationPluginInterface[]
     */
    protected function getApplicationPlugins(): array
    {
        return [
            new TwigApplicationPlugin(),
            new EventDispatcherApplicationPlugin(),
            // ...
        ];
    }

// ...
```
