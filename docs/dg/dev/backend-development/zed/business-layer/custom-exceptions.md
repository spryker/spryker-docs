To throw an exception, you need to define your own type of exception. Later, it's much easier to handle exceptions when the type represents a specific type of error.

{% info_block errorBox %}

In Spryker *exceptions* and *errors* are handled in a central error handler that doesn't stop the execution. Do not use exceptions as events to control the workflow. Only expected exceptions are caught—for example, when you deal with external systems; or when you must guarantee the execution—for example, when you send an email in the checkout then this must not break the execution.

{% endinfo_block %}

Usually, exceptions have an empty body and extend the `global \Exception` class.

```php
<?php

namespace Pyz\Zed\Glossary\Business\Exception;

use Exception;

class KeyExistsException extends Exception
{
}
```
