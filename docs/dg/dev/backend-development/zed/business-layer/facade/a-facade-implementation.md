## AbstractFacade

Every facade extends `Spryker\Zed\Kernel\Business\AbstractFacade`, which provides an important method:

| METHOD  | PURPOSE  |
| --- | --- |
| $this->getFactory() | Returns the factory needed to access the underlying models. |

## Methods

Inside a facade, the methods tell a story about the module. They expose the module's functions and delegate calls to internal models. A typical method looks like this:

```php
<?php
class GlossaryFacade extends AbstractFacade
{
    /**
     * @param string $keyName
     * @return bool
     */
    public function deleteKey($keyName)
    {
        $keyManager = $this->getFactory()->createKeyManager();
        return $keyManager->deleteKey($keyName);
    {% raw %}}}{% endraw %}
```

When you look at the `deleteKey()` method, observe the following:

- The method's name expresses exactly what happens. It uses the terms of the related terminology, but it's easy to grasp what happens ("A key is deleted").
- The method does not contain any control logic, like `if` or `foreach` statements; it just delegates to the business model and calls the right method.
- The business model KeyManager is created using the factory, so it does not need to know how the class is created.

## Parameters and return values

The main idea of the facade is to hide the implementation details. Typical return values of facade methods are the following:
- Native types (bool, int, float, string, array)
- Transfer objects

To hide and protect the underlying models and data structure, business models, or any propel entities and queries are never returned.

## Transfer objects

Each module ships with its own interface for each transfer object that is used. Transfer objects are much more descriptive compared to arrays.

```php
<?php
class GlossaryFacade extends AbstractFacade
{
    /**
     * @param CmsGlossaryTransfer $transferTranslation
     * @return CmsGlossaryTransfer
     */
    public function saveTranslation(CmsGlossaryTransfer $translationTransfer)
    {
        $translationManager = $this->getFactory()->createTranslationManager();
        return $translationManager->saveTranslation($translationTransfer);
    }
}
```

## Encapsulation

The idea of the `Business` layer is to present a facade to all clients and hide the internal details. This is the main requirement for future updates, and it keeps the bundles decoupled. So when you look at a module from another module, you only see the facade.
