In Spryker, an entity represents one entry from a table in the database. Entities are an implementation of the [Active record design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern), so their usage is very simple. For more details, see [Propel's Active Record Reference](http://propelorm.org/documentation/reference/active-record.html).

{% info_block warningBox %}

Spryker's entities are called Active Record classes or just Models there.

{% endinfo_block %}

```php
<?php
$customer = new SpyCustomer();
$customer->setFirstName('John');
$customer->setLastName('Doe');
$customer->setEmail('john.doe@spryker.com');
$customer->save();
```

## Saving Entities With Transactions

In general, Propel performs every `save` operation in a transaction. Sometimes, you want to save things togetherâ€”for example, when you save customers and order items during the checkout. For this, you can use Propel's connection.

```php
 <?php
 $connection = Propel::getConnection();
 $connection->beginTransaction();

 $customerEntity->save();
 $customerAddressEntity->save();
 $salesOrderEntity->save();
 $connection->commit();
```

## Entity Usage

Usually, entities are used in the module's `Business` layer to persist data. In contrast to most other classes in Spryker, entities are never injected because they have a state. Another way to retrieve entities is to use a query from the query container.
