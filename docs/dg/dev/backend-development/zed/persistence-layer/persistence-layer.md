Zed's `Persistence` layer is the owner of the schema, entities, and queries. This layer knows the database structure and holds the connection to it.

## Integrated technologies

Propel Fast and simple ORM Framework MySQL or PostgreSQL. Both databases are supported.

## Persistence layer elements

| ELEMENT   | DESCRIPTION |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Repository          | Repository is used to read from the database. |
| Entity manager | Entity manager allows operating with table contents. |
| Entities | Entity represents a single row from the database. |
|Queries| Query objects provide an object-oriented API for writing database queries. |
| Schema definition | XML files that define the database schema for the related module.|
| Persistence factory | Factory is used to instantiate query objects. |

The following diagram shows how the elements interact:
