{% info_block infoBox "When to use query containers" %}

Don't use query containers to cross module boundaries, as this increases module coupling. However, you can use them behind [Repository](/docs/dg/dev/backend-development/zed/persistence-layer/repository.html) and [Entity Manager](/docs/dg/dev/backend-development/zed/persistence-layer/entity-manager.html) as query aggregations.

Previously, query containers were used to cross-module borders (using dependency providers), which led to higher module coupling and leaking of the `Persistence` layer from one domain object to another, and therefore, to higher maintenance efforts and lower code reusability. This approach is deprecated, so we don't recommend using query containers like this in your project development.

{% endinfo_block %}

A query container holds all the database queries of the current module.

Each module has exactly one query container, which also acts as an entry point to the `Persistence` layer. Internally, it uses [query objects](/docs/dg/dev/backend-development/zed/persistence-layer/query-objects-creation-and-usage.html) and returns unterminated queries.

As you can see in the following example, the query container consists of `query-methods`. It gets [query objects](/docs/dg/dev/backend-development/zed/persistence-layer/query-objects-creation-and-usage.html) from the [factory](/docs/dg/dev/backend-development/factory/factory.html), adds some filters or joins, and returns the unterminated query object.

 Avoid unterminated queries in the Application layers above `Persistence`. To decouple persistence and ORM implementation details, consider using the [Repository](/docs/dg/dev/backend-development/zed/persistence-layer/repository.html) and [Entity Manager](/docs/dg/dev/backend-development/zed/persistence-layer/entity-manager.html) patterns.

Unterminated means you don't execute the query with `find()`, `findOne()`, or `count()`.

```php
use Spryker\Zed\Kernel\Persistence\AbstractQueryContainer;

/**
 * @method \Pyz\Zed\MyBundle\Persistence\MyBundlePersistenceFactory getFactory()
 */
class MyBundleQueryContainer extends AbstractQueryContainer implements MyBundleQueryContainerInterface
{
    public function queryTemplateByPath($path)
    {
        $query = $this->getFactory()->createTemplateQuery();
        $query->filterByTemplatePath($path);

        return $query;
    }
}
```
