Zed is divided into three parts:
* The [Business](/docs/dg/dev/backend-development/zed/business-layer/business-layer.html) layer: Contains the entire business logic.
* The [Persistence](/docs/dg/dev/backend-development/zed/persistence-layer/persistence-layer.html) layer: Responsible for the database structure and connections to it—for example, for the data persistence.
* The [Communication](/docs/dg/dev/backend-development/zed/communication-layer/communication-layer.html) layer: Enables the connection to the external providers.
