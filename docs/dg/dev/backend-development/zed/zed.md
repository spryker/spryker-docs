- The [Business](/docs/dg/dev/backend-development/zed/business-layer/business-layer.html) layer: Contains the entire business logic.
- The [Persistence](/docs/dg/dev/backend-development/zed/persistence-layer/persistence-layer.html) layer: Responsible for the database structure and connections to itâ€”for example, for the data persistence.
- The [Communication](/docs/dg/dev/backend-development/zed/communication-layer/communication-layer.html) layer: Enables the connection to the external providers.
