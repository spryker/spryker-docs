This document provides details how web components are used and what their function is in the Merchant Portal Frontend.

## Introduction

Merchant Portal is primarily developed using Angular Components and Angular infrastructure. Twig exposes a component as a *Web Component* when it needs to be accessed from Twig.
Internal components will remain as Angular Components unless they are required to be used from the Twig side.

## Overview

Web Components are a collection of technologies for creating reusable custom elementsâ€”with their functionality encapsulated away from the rest of your code and incorporated into your web applications.

Below is an example of how to register Angular components as web components:

```ts
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { WebComponentsModule } from '@spryker/web-components';

import { SomeComponentComponent } from './some-component/some-component.component';
import { SomeComponentModule } from './some-component/some-component.module';

@NgModule({
    imports: [
        WebComponentsModule.withComponents([SomeComponentComponent]),
        SomeComponentModule,
    ],
    providers: [],
})
export class ComponentsModule {}
```

In the registration process, web components will automatically get a `web` prefix to their selectors. Selectors can also be customized.

```ts
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { WebComponentsModule } from '@spryker/web-components';

import { SomeComponentComponent } from './some-component/some-component.component';
import { SomeComponentModule } from './some-component/some-component.module';

@NgModule({
    imports: [
        WebComponentsModule.withComponents([
            {
                selector: 'new-web-component-selector',
                component: SomeComponentComponent,
            },
        ]),
        SomeComponentModule,
    ],
    providers: [],
})
export class ComponentsModule {}
```

The complete process of creating a new module and registering it as a web component can be found in the [How-To: Create a new Angular module with application](/docs/dg/dev/frontend-development/{{page.version}}/create-angular-modules.html).
