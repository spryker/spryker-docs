This document explains the structure of the frontend project in the Spryker Marketplace.

## Alias

Use the alias `@mp/spryker-module-name` with the proper Spryker module name to import vendor Angular components, modules or services into .js files, for example, `import { registerNgModule } from '@mp/zed-ui'`.

## Module structure

Below you can find a general structure of every frontend module in the Spryker Marketplace:

- MODULE_NAME
  - src/Spryker/Zed/MODULE_NAME
    - Presentation—this is the namespace where the marketplace frontend-related files are located.
      - Components—all Angular files are located here.
        - entry.ts—registers all Angular NgModules via `registerNgModule` from `@mp/zed-ui/app/registry`
        - app—contains Angular components and services.
          - components.module.ts—an Angular NgModule with components, such as web components (extends `CustomElementModule` from `@spryker/web-components`).
        - public-api—exports all public components / modules / services / types / tokens.
      - TWIG_FOLDER—a folder with twig view.
  - mp.public-api.ts—exports the public-api file.
  - package.json—adds `MODULE_NAME` specific packages.

## Main entry points

The following entry points are needed for the Angular config to build the frontend project.

- ZedUi (Project)
  - Presentation
    - Components
      - app
        - app.module.ts—a module with the default configuration modules and bootstrap for the web-components.
      - assets—all assets are located here.
      - environment—this folder contains the base configuration file, `environment.ts`.
      - index.html—entry for html file in the `angular.json` (not used for Spryker needs, exists for configuration only).
      - main.ts—compiles the web-app and bootstraps the `AppModule` to run in the browser.
      - polyfills.ts—used to provide modern functionality for older browsers that do not natively support it.
      - styles.less—extends global styles.
