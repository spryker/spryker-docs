This document explains the Table Feature Pagination component in the Components Library.

## Overview

Table Feature Pagination is a feature of the Table Component that renders pagination of the table.
This feature is based on the Pagination component.

Check out an example usage of the Table Feature Pagination in the `@spryker/table` config.

Component configuration:

- `enabled`—enables the feature via config.  
- `sizes`—an array of numbers of table rows that needs to be displayed per page.  

```html
<spy-table
    [config]="{
        dataSource: { ... },
        columns: [ ... ],
        pagination: {
            enabled: true,
            sizes: [10, 50, 100],
        },                                                                                           
    }"
>
</spy-table>
```

## Component registration

```ts
declare module '@spryker/table' {

        TableModule.withFeatures({
            pagination: () =>
                import('@spryker/table.feature.pagination').then(
                    (m) => m.TablePaginationFeatureModule,
                ),
        }),
    ],
})
export class RootModule {}
```

    ],
})
