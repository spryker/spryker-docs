This document explains the Table Feature Title component in the Components Library.

## Overview

Table Feature Title is a feature of the Table Component that renders the title of the table.

Check out an example usage of the Table Feature Title in the `@spryker/table` config.

Component configuration:

- `enabled`—enables the feature via config.  
- `title`—a table title text.  

```html
<spy-table
    [config]="{
        dataSource: { ... },
        columns: [ ... ],
        title: {
            enabled: true,
            title: 'Table title',
        },                                                                                           
    }"
>
</spy-table>
```

## Component registration

Register the component:

```ts
declare module '@spryker/table' {
    interface TableConfig {
        title?: TableTitleConfig;
    }
}

@NgModule({

        TableModule.forRoot(),
        TableModule.withFeatures({
            title: () =>
                import('@spryker/table.feature.title').then(
                    (m) => m.TableTitleFeatureModule,
                ),
        }),
    ],
})
export class RootModule {}
```

    ],
})
