Unsafe coding practices can expose your application to the theft of sensitive data. In this document, we recommend coding practices for developing your app to ensure its security.

## How to add new external package to your project

Before adding a new external package to your project, make sure to comply with the following security recommendations:

### Regularly check security

1. Check that the package has no known security vulnerabilities.
2. To regularly check all packages, add an automated SAST&SCA tool to your CI/CD.

### Perform regular compliance checks

Every package comes with a license. Do the following:
1. Check with your legal team that you can use the package with its license.
2. To regularly check all packages, add an automated tool to your CI/CD.

We recommend [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) for all the listed recommendations. However, you are free to use any other tool.
