This guide explains how to use `ActiveRecordBatchProcessorTrait` and `CascadeActiveRecordBatchProcessorTrait` to optimize Propel entity persistence. These traits reduce database round trips, prevent the N+1 problem, and support efficient batch inserts and updates. Youâ€™ll also learn how to handle related entity persistence and post-save hooks using `BatchEntityPostSaveInterface` and `BatchEntityHooksInterface`.



## Prerequisites

[spryker/propel:^3.45.0](https://github.com/spryker/propel/releases/tag/3.45.0)

### ActiveRecordBatchProcessorTrait

ActiveRecordBatchProcessorTrait provides performance optimizations for database operations by enabling saving Propel entities in batches. This reduces database round trips, improves overall performance, and solves the [N+1 problem](/docs/dg/dev/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-performance-issues/n+1-problem.html).

### Usage example

``` php
class EntityManager {
    use ActiveRecordBatchProcessorTrait;

    public function processItems(array $itemTransfers): void {

        $items = // Load or create all entities at once from database

        // Queue entities for batch processing
        foreach ($items as $item) {
            $this->persist($item);
        }

        // Save all collected entities in a single batch
        $this->commit();
    }
}
```

### Key methods

- `persist($entity)`: Adds an entity to the batch queue. Handles separation for insert and update operations.
- `commit()`: When this method is called, each type of database operation, such as insert and update, is executed within its own dedicated transaction. For each failed operation, the corresponding transaction is rolled back, and an exception is thrown. This ensures data consistency and prevents partial writes in case of failure.

## CascadeActiveRecordBatchProcessorTrait

- Extends `ActiveRecordBatchProcessorTrait` by adding recursive cascade-saving functionality for related entities
- Helps manage complex entity relationships during batch processing
- Works with `BatchEntityPostSaveInterface`, which enables organizing `postSave` events for related entities in a batch-safe manner

### Usage example

Implementation:

```php
class AbstractSpySalesOrderItem extends BaseSpySalesOrderItem implements BatchEntityPostSaveInterface
{
    // properties re-declared protected to prevent their direct use out from an entity
    use CascadeActiveRecordBatchProcessorTrait {
        persist as protected;
        commit as protected;
        commitIdentical as protected;
    }
    public function batchPostSave(): void
    {
        if ($this->statusChanged && $this->getIdSalesOrderItem()) {
            /** @var \Orm\Zed\Sales\Persistence\SpySalesOrderItem $salesOrderItemEntity */
            $salesOrderItemEntity = $this;
            $omsOrderItemStateHistoryEntity = $this->createOmsOrderItemStateHistoryEntity();
            $omsOrderItemStateHistoryEntity->setOrderItem($salesOrderItemEntity);
            $omsOrderItemStateHistoryEntity->setFkOmsOrderItemState($this->getFkOmsOrderItemState());

            $this->sharedPersist($omsOrderItemStateHistoryEntity);
        }

        $this->statusChanged = false;
    }
}
```

With this implementation, the following example works as follows:
- Loads all required entities from the database in a single query
- Creates or updates `salesOrderItem` entities in a single batch
- Creates `OrderItemStateHistoryEntity` instances during post-save processing and saves them in a single batch operation after the main entity's save. Post save processing is handled by `batchPostSave` method declared by `BatchEntityPostSaveInterface`


```php
class SalesEntityManager extends AbstractEntityManager implements SalesEntityManagerInterface
{
    public function updateOrCreateSalesOrderItems(array $salesOrderItemsData): void
    {
        // Use batch processor trait for efficient processing
        foreach ($salesOrderItemsData as $orderItemData) {
            // Find or create the sales order item
            $salesOrderItem = $this->findOrCreateSalesOrderItem($orderItemData);
    
            // Update item attributes
            $this->updateSalesOrderItemAttributes($salesOrderItem, $orderItemData);
    
            // Collect for batch processing
            $this->persist($salesOrderItem);
        }
    
        // Commit all collected items in a single batch operation
    $this->commit();
    }
}
```


## BatchEntityHooksInterface

BatchEntityHooksInterface provides `postSave` hooks similar to publish and synchronize (P&S) events. When using `ActiveRecordBatchProcessorTrait` or `CascadeActiveRecordBatchProcessorTrait`, storage and search entities must explicitly implement this interface to ensure proper event handling during batch operations because these traits do not automatically trigger P&S events.

### Usage example

```php
class AbstractSpyProductOfferStorage extends BaseSpyProductOfferStorage implements BatchEntityHooksInterface
{
    public function batchPreSaveHook(): void
    {
        if (method_exists($this, 'isSynchronizationEnabled') && $this->isSynchronizationEnabled()) {
            // synchronization behavior
            $this->setGeneratedKey();
            $this->setGeneratedKeyForMappingResource();
            $this->setGeneratedAliasKeys();
        }
    }

    public function batchPostSaveHook(): void
    {
        if (method_exists($this, 'isSynchronizationEnabled') && $this->isSynchronizationEnabled()) {
            // synchronization behavior
            $this->syncPublishedMessage();
            $this->syncPublishedMessageForMappingResource();
            $this->syncPublishedMessageForMappings();
        }
    }
```

When saving the `SpyProductOfferStorage` entity using `ActiveRecordBatchProcessorTrait`, the P&S event is triggered after the batch save completes.

## Limitations and recommendations

- Entity ID access: `ActiveRecordBatchProcessorTrait` doesn't return entity IDs after saving. If you need the ID, perform a separate database query.

- Memory usage : The `$entityList` property stores entities in memory. To avoid memory issues, keep batch sizes reasonable and call `commit()` periodically.

- Insert limits : The `ActiveRecordBatchProcessorTrait` trait doesn't enforce a limit on the number of entities you can insert in one operation. However, databases have limits on payload size. Use sensible chunk sizes.

- Update limits : The default update limit is 200 entities per batch. This is defined by `ActiveRecordBatchProcessorTrait::UPDATE_CHUNK_SIZE`. You can override this limit by extending the trait in your `EntityManager`.
