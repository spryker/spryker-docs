- [General performance guidelines](/docs/dg/dev/guidelines/performance-guidelines/general-performance-guidelines.html) for general approaches to optimizing the server-side execution time.
- [Architecture performance guidelines](/docs/dg/dev/guidelines/performance-guidelines/architecture-performance-guidelines.html) to optimize performance in the very end servers.
- [Frontend performance guidelines](/docs/dg/dev/guidelines/performance-guidelines/front-end-performance-guidelines.html) to do the frontend-specific optimization.
