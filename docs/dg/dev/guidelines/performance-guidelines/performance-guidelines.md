These performance guidelines originate from Spryker's years of experience across all kinds of projects, environments, and setups. They cover topics that are often missed at the project level, leading to poor performance or other related issues. The guidelines help you analyze and optimize performance of your website from different perspectives:

- [Monitoring](/docs/dg/dev/guidelines/performance-guidelines/monitoring.html) to ensure effective application monitoring using APM tools.
- [General performance guidelines](/docs/dg/dev/guidelines/performance-guidelines/general-performance-guidelines.html) for general approaches to optimizing the server-side execution time.
- [Architecture performance guidelines](/docs/dg/dev/guidelines/performance-guidelines/architecture-performance-guidelines.html) to optimize performance in the very end servers.
- [Frontend performance guidelines](/docs/dg/dev/guidelines/performance-guidelines/front-end-performance-guidelines.html) to do the frontend-specific optimization.
- [Twig performance best practices](/docs/dg/dev/guidelines/performance-guidelines/twig-performance-best-practices.html) to optimize Twig templating engine performance.
- [Session locks](/docs/dg/dev/guidelines/performance-guidelines/session-locks.html) to optimize session locking mechanisms and reduce performance impact. Also see [Redis session lock](/docs/dg/dev/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-performance-issues/redis-session-lock.html) for troubleshooting session lock issues.
- [Bot control](/docs/dg/dev/guidelines/performance-guidelines/bot-control.html) to manage honest and malicious bot traffic effectively.
- [Batch processing of Propel entities](/docs/dg/dev/guidelines/performance-guidelines/performance-guidelines-batch-processing-propel-entities.html) for efficient batch processing, reduced database load, and support for complex entity relationships.
- [External HTTP requests](/docs/dg/dev/guidelines/performance-guidelines/external-http-requests.html) to manage external HTTP requests.
- [Troubleshooting performance issues](/docs/dg/dev/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-performance-issues/troubleshooting-performance-issues.html) for detecting and fixing common performance problems.
