Cypress is an end-to-end testing framework that provides a modern approach to testing web applications. Spryker provides a Cypress boilerplate project with pre-configured setup, best practices, and examples for testing Spryker-based applications.

## Cypress boilerplate

For comprehensive information on setting up and using Cypress with Spryker, refer to the [cypress-boilerplate](https://github.com/spryker-projects/cypress-boilerplate) repository.

The boilerplate includes:
- Pre-configured Cypress setup optimized for Spryker projects
- Example test cases and patterns
- Documentation and best practices
- Integration guides

The boilerplate does NOT include:
- Complete test coverage - you should add and adjust example tests to fit your project
- Correct locators - the locators in the boilerplace are based on Spryker demo shops, adjust the locators in accordance with your project
