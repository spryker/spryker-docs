Data builders help you create transfer objects for your tests. Instead of preparing transfers each time you need them, data builders do the work for you. Data builders use the [Faker library](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker).

Data builders need to be configured only once, and then they are ready to use. The configuration is done within a `module.databuilder.xml` file that has to be placed into the `_data` directory.

Here is an example for a data builder configuration:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<transfers
    xmlns="spryker:databuilder-01"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="spryker:databuilder-01 http://static.spryker.com/databuilder-01.xsd"
>

    <transfer name="Customer">
        <property name="firstName" dataBuilderRule="firstName"/>
    </transfer>

</transfers>
```

In your test, you will use the data builder with:

```php
$customerTransfer = (new CustomerBuilder())->build();
```

With this code, you get `CustomerTransfer` that is filled by the [Faker library](https://github.com/fzaninotto/Faker) with the defined data builder rules. When passing the optional `$seedData` to the constructor, the values you pass will be used instead.
