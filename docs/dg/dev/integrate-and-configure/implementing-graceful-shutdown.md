When a running process is stopped by, for example, signals like `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT`, the process is stopped right away, no matter if it's completed or not. Sometimes, such behavior is not acceptableâ€”for example, in the case of half imported data set.

To make sure that a process is shut down gracefully, use the `GracefulRunner` module and pass `\Generator` to its `GracefulRunnerFacadeInterface::run()` method. `GracefulRunnerFacadeInterface::run()` uses the [signal handler](https://github.com/Seldaek/signal-handler) to register a new handler [with pcntl_signal](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.pcntl-signal.php), and wraps the passed `\Generator`.  Until a signal is sent, the `\Generator::next()` method is executed to make sure that one step of your process is fully completed before the script shuts down.

Example:

```php
public function import(Collection $collection): void
{
    $this->gracefulRunnerFacade->run(
        $this->createImportGenerator($collection)
    );
}

protected function createImportGenerator(Collection $collection): \Generator
{
    foreach ($collections as $collectionItem) {
        yield; // Turns this method into a `\Generator`

        // Code that needs to completely run before script is shutdown.
        // The GracefulRunner takes care of execution and will stop
        // after an iteration was completed when a signal was received.
    }
}
```

## Handle exceptions

To throw an exception into the Generator code, you can use the second argument of the `GracefulRunnerFacadeInterface::run()` method. It's the class name that must be thrown into the Generator when a signal is handled. The following example explains it in more detail:

```php
public function import(Collection $collection): void
{
    $this->gracefulRunnerFacade->run(
        $this->createImportGenerator($collection, YourException::class)
    );
}

protected function createImportGenerator(Collection $collection): \Generator
{
    foreach ($collections as $collectionItem) {
        yield; // Turns this method into a `\Generator`

        try {
            // Code that needs to run completely before the script is shut down.
            // The GracefulRunner takes care of the execution and will stop
            // after an iteration was completed when a signal was received.
        } catch (YourException $exception) {
            // When a signal is handled you end up here.
        }
    }
}
```
