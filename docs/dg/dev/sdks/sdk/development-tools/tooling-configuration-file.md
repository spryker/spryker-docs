In order to make the tool configuring more convenient, we introduced the `.tooling.yml` file. It contains a variety of settings for different tools in one place, helping you to keep the number of files on the root level as small as possible. The `.tooling.yml` file should also be in `.gitattributes` to be ignored for tagging:

```yml
... export-ignore
```

The following tools and directives are supported.

## Code sniffer

The code sniffer configuration section can have one directive: level. Example:

```yml
code-sniffer:
    level: 1
 ```

## Architecture sniffer

The architecture sniffer configuration section can have two directives: priority and ignoreErrors. Example:

```yml
architecture-sniffer:
    priority: 5
    ignoreErrors:
        - '#DependencyProvider#'
        - '#DevelopmentCommunicationFactory#'
```

Note that the keywords listed in the **ignoreErrors** directive are regular expressions. They are used to match the lines in the error list provided as a result of the architecture sniffer doing its job.
