Initialize a project with a specific workflow:

```bash
spryker-sdk init:sdk:project --workflow={workflowName}
```

If the project was initialized, it's limited to the workflows specified during initialization.

Add a workflow to an initialized project:

**{PROJECT_FOLDER}/.ssdk/settings**

```yaml
# {projectDir}/.ssdk/settings
project_key: e9abab71-59f3-e9ff-468c-7a6d28e10724
workflow:
    - app # app workflow
```

Run a workflow:

```bash
spryker-sdk sdk:workflow:run {workflowName}
```

Two identical top-level workflows can't run inside the same project.


## Workflow commands

- List all available workflows:

```bash
spryker-sdk sdk:workflow:list
```

- Generate an SVG image for a specific workflow:

```bash
spryker-sdk sdk:workflow:show {workflowName}
```

- Initialize project settings with a workflow:

```bash
spryker-sdk sdk:init:project --workflow={workflowName} --workflow={workflowName}
```

{% info_block warningBox Workflow Initialization %}

If you initialize workflows for a project, you can use only these workflows.

{% endinfo_block %}

- Run the workflow process:

```bash
spryker-sdk sdk:workflow:run {workflowName}
```

## Workflows configuration reference

In the SDK directory, the workflows are defined in the workflow YAML files, located  either in `config/packages`, or in the configuration of extension bundles.

See the basic workflow documentation in the [Symfony docs](https://symfony.com/doc/current/workflow.html).

Additionally, you can configure and extend the workflow behavior by providing some specific metadata options:
- `transitionResolver`: `sdk:workflow:run`. The `service` should implement `\SprykerSdk\SdkContracts\Workflow\TransitionResolverInterface` as shown in the [example workflow definition](#example-workflow-definition).
- `allowToFail: true`: `sdk:workflow:run`. Sets the next place if task failed.
- `re-run: true`: `sdk:workflow:run`. Runs the workflow multiple times when the current one has finished.
- `run: single`: `sdk:workflow:run`. Runs only a single transition and exits. If this setting is omitted, the task runs available transitions one by one, asking which one to run if multiple possible variants exist.
- `before: service_name`. The service `service_name` should implement `\SprykerSdk\Sdk\Extension\Dependency\Event\WorkflowEventHandlerInterface` and is called before the transition occurs.
- `after: service_name`. The service `service_name` should implement `\SprykerSdk\Sdk\Extension\Dependency\Event\WorkflowEventHandlerInterface` and is called after the transition occurs.
- `guard: service_name`. The service `service_name` should implement `\SprykerSdk\Sdk\Extension\Dependency\Event\WorkflowGuardEventHandlerInterface` and is called to determine if the transition is available.
- `task: task_name`. The task `task_name` is executed inside the transition, and the transition can stop depending on its result.
- `workflowBefore: workflow_name`. The workflow `workflow_name` runs inside the transition, and should end before proceeding to the task execution.
- `workflowAfter: workflow_name`. The workflow `workflow_name` runs inside the transition after the task is executed and should end before finishing the transition.
