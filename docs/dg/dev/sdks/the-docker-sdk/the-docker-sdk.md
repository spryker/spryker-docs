Spryker Docker SDK is a tool designed to help you set up a Docker environment for your Spryker project.

The tool builds a production-like Docker infrastructure for Spryker based on the provided [Deploy file](/docs/dg/dev/sdks/the-docker-sdk/deploy-file/deploy-file-reference.html).

Spryker Docker SDK is used for the following purposes:

1. Building production-like Docker images.
2. Serving as part of a development environment based on Docker.
3. Simplifying the process of setting up a local demo of Spryker project.

This document provides details on how the Docker SDK is organized internally and works under the hood.

## Docker SDK repository structure

The [docker-sdk repository](https://github.com/spryker/docker-sdk) contains the following folders:

* [bin](https://github.com/spryker/docker-sdk/tree/master/bin): structured sh commands that are copied and used in the containers.
* [ci](https://github.com/spryker/docker-sdk/tree/master/ci): Travis deployment pipeline, basic tests.
* [context](https://github.com/spryker/docker-sdk/tree/master/context): service configurations, such as PHP, MySQL, nginx, etc.
* [deployment](https://github.com/spryker/docker-sdk/tree/master/deployment): Docker images, configs, and assets generated by the Docker SDK for the current project. These artefacts are necessary for building the Spryker application containers and services.
* [docs](https://github.com/spryker/docker-sdk/tree/master/docs): usage documentation.
* [generator](https://github.com/spryker/docker-sdk/tree/master/generator): generator of the `deployment` folder.
* [images](https://github.com/spryker/docker-sdk/tree/master/images): Docker files for services, applications, etc.

## Docker/sdk boot command details

The Docker SDK `boot` command runs the [generator](https://github.com/spryker/docker-sdk/tree/master/generator) application. The generator is deployed as a Docker container. It takes twig templates and project's `deploy.yml` with context and generates the content of the [deployment](https://github.com/spryker/docker-sdk/tree/master/deployment) folder.

The `boot` command does the following:
1. Prepares the env files for Glue, Zed, and Yves.
2. Prepares endpoints and store-specific configs.
3. Prepares the Nginx configuration for the frontend and gateway containers.
4. Prepares the PHP and debug configuration.
5. Prepares Terraform env files.
6. Prepares Dashboard.
7. Prepares the Docker image files and the `docker-compose.yml` file for local development.
8. Generates bash scripts used by `deploy.sh`.
9. Shows the list of commands that are necessary to complete installation.

## Docker/sdk up command details

The Docker SDK `up` command does the following:

1. Prepares data in `deployment/default/deploy.sh`:
   1. Mounts Mutagen:
      1. Removes the sync volume.
      2. Terminates Mutagen.
      3. Creates the volume.
   2. Builds app images in CLI with the `docker/sdk build` command.
   3. Tags application images with the `docker/sdk tag` command.
   4. Mounts codebase with the following commands:
      * `install composer`
      * `install -s build`
      * `build-{mode}`
   5. Mounts assets with the following commands:
      * `install -s build-static`
      * `build-static-{mode}`
   6. Builds frontend and gateway containers from an Nginx image.
2. Runs containers:
   1. Runs before stack.
   2. Runs containers.
   3. Runs after stack.
3. Loads data for each region:
   1. Skips if the database is not empty. If you provide the `--data` argument, then the command is "forced".
   2. Installs and configures RabbitMQ on broker container with the `rabbitmqctl add_vhost â€¦` command.
   3. Suspends scheduler and waits for job termination.
   4. Initiates storages for each store with the `install -s init_storages_per_store` command.
   5. If the database does not exist, creates it on MySQL or PostreSQL container.
4. Starts a scheduler for each region and store with the `install -s scheduler-setup` command.

## Docker/sdk working mode commands

In the *testing* mode, you can use the `docker/sdk testing` and `docker/sdk (up|start) -t` commands.

The `docker/sdk testing` command does the following:
* Sets the `SPRYKER_TESTING_ENABLE` variable in the frontend, gateway, and app containers.
* Builds and runs the webdriver container if it does not exist.
* Stops the scheduler to ensure isolation and control.
* Runs the CLI container and executes the requested command.

The `docker/sdk (up|start) -t` command does the following:
* Sets the `SPRYKER_TESTING_ENABLE` variable in the frontend, gateway, and app containers.
* Builds and runs the webdriver container if it does not exist.
* Stops the scheduler to ensure isolation and control.
* Executes the `docker/sdk cli -t ...` command to enter CLI container in the test mode or to run commands.

{% info_block infoBox "Leaving the testing mode" %}

To leave the testing mode, run `docker/sdk up|start`. This command shuts down the web driver and starts the scheduler again.

{% endinfo_block %}

In the *debug* mode, you can run the `docker/sdk cli -x` command. This command sets the `SPRYKER_XDEBUG_ENABLE` variable to allow CLI debugging.

{% info_block infoBox "Info" %}

Debugging from your browser by adding a cookie to the HTTP request works automatically.

{% endinfo_block %}

## Other docker/sdk commands

The `docker/sdk run` or `start` command does the following:
* Executes the `docker-compose up -d` command.
* Executes the `docker-compose restart` command that restarts the frontend and gateway containers.
* Waits until the services are up and running.

The `docker/sdk stop` command stops running containers with the `docker-compose stop` command.

The `docker/sdk restart` command does the following:
* Executes the `docker/sdk stop` command.
* Executes the `docker/sdk start` command.

The `docker/sdk install` command prints information about what you should do to complete the installation. For example, it shows information about how to add hosts to the `/etc/hosts` file, warns about incompatible OS or software,  etc.

The `docker/sdk down` command executes `docker-compose down`, which stops and removes containers and networks.

The `docker/sdk prune` command does the following:
* Executes the `docker-compose down -v` command.
* Executes the `docker prune` command for images, volumes, system, and builder.

The `docker/sdk reset`  command does the following:
* Executes `docker-compose down -v`
* Executes `docker/sdk up --build --assets --data --jobs`

The `docker/sdk clean-data` command stops and removes the following containers and volumes with  `docker-compose down -v`:
* Logs
* `/data` folder for Zed, Yves, and Glue
* Broker data: `/var/lib/rabbitmq`
* Session and key-value data: `/data`
* Search data: `/usr/share/elasticsearch/data`
* Scheduler data

The `docker/sdk trouble` command does the following:
* Executes `docker-compose down`.
* Cleans sync volumes for `docker-sync`.

The `docker/sdk build` command builds the following data:
* Images: executes the `docker build` command for app and Nginx images; builds codebase and assets.
* Codebase: executes `composer install`, `install -s build`, `build-{mode}`.
* Assets: executes `install -s build-static`, `build-static-{mode}`.

The `docker/sdk pull` command executes `docker-compose pull`, which pulls all the external images, based on `docker-compose.yml`.

The `docker/sdk demo` command does the following:
* Executes the `docker-compose up -d` command.
* Runs the demo data installation process for each region.

The `docker/sdk export images {tag}` command is only for the baked mode. It does the following:
* Builds and tags docker application images.
* Based on assetsBuilder and CLI image, builds the assets builder docker image. Runs `vendor/bin-install -s build-static build-static-{mode}`.
* Builds and tags frontend images.
* Prints information about the built images.

 The `docker/sdk robot-framework {command}` command executes sets of API and UI tests, built on the Robot Framework.

## Development environment

The following schema illustrates the development environment with the Docker SDK:
![development-environment](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/dev/the-docker-sdk/the-docker-sdk/development-environment.png)

{% info_block infoBox "Info" %}

Depending on the Spryker version used, instead of `zed_eu`, you can have the following containers: `backoffice_eu`, `backend_gateway_eu`, and `backend_api_eu`.

{% endinfo_block %}

In the development environment, Gateway (Nginx) does the following:

* Accepts all public HTTP requests.
* Handles SSL connections.
* Serves all non-application services.
* Proxies application calls to Frontend (Nginx).

Frontend (Nginx) is an HTTP to FastCGI proxy for Glue, Yves, Zed, and serves assets.

## Docker/sdk debug mode

## Extending Docker/sdk

To extend Docker/sdk, you can do the following:

* To use a custom PHP or Nginx image and add extensions or libraries, you can change the application image:

   ```
   environment: docker.dev
   image:
      tag: spryker/php 8.0
      tag: registry.gitlab.com/my-company/spryker:1.0-php8debsap
   ```

  This approach is compatible with SCCOS, but provides limited customization possibilities.

* To introduce "mocks" for development and CI/CD testing, you can use the [Docker-compose extension](https://docs.docker.com/compose/extends/):

  ```
  docker:
   compose:
      yamls:
         - {custom_compose_file_name}

  ```

  This approach works for development and CI/CD only, but it's not compatible with SCCOS setup.
