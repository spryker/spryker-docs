This document describes the prerequisites for installing Spryker on MacOS.


## System requirements for installing Spryker

Review the system and software requirements in the table and configure them using the following instructions.

| REQUIREMENT | VALUE OR VERSION |
| --- | --- |
| Docker | 18.09.1 or higher |
| Docker Compose | 2.0 or higher |  
| vCPU | 4 or more |
| RAM  | 16GB or more |
| Swap  | 4GB or more |


## Install and configure a Docker manager

You can run Spryker in Docker using Docker Desktop or OrbStack. Docker Desktop is a free default tool, but OrbStack works faster with intel-based Macs.


### Install Docker Desktop

1. Download and install [Docker Desktop (Mac)](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/).

{% info_block infoBox %}

Signup for Docker Hub is not required.

{% endinfo_block %}

2. Accept the privilege escalation request "Docker Desktop needs privileged access.".

3. In the Docker Desktop, go to preferences by selecting the gear in the top right corner.

4. In the **General** section of **Preferences**, click the **Use Docker Compose V2** checkbox.

5. Set recommended memory and swap limits:

    1. Go to **Resources** > **ADVANCED**.
    2. Set **CPUs:** to "4" or higher.
    3. Set **Memory:** to "16.00 GB" or higher.
    4. Set **Swap:** to "4.00 GB" or higher.
    5. Set the desired **Disk image size:**.
    6. Select the desired **Disk image location**.
    7. Select **Apply & Restart**.

### Install OrbStack

Download and install [OrbStack](https://orbstack.dev/download).


To migrate from Docker Desktop to OrbStack, see [Migrate from Docker to OrbStack](https://docs.orbstack.dev/install#docker-migration).
To run Docker Desktop and OrbStack side-by-side and switch between them, see [Side-by-side](https://docs.orbstack.dev/install#docker-context).

## Install Mutagen for development mode

If you are going to run Spryker in [development mode](/docs/dg/dev/set-up-spryker-locally/install-spryker/install/choose-an-installation-mode.html#development-mode), install or update Mutagen and Mutagen Compose to the latest version:

```bash
brew list | grep mutagen | xargs brew remove && brew install mutagen-io/mutagen/mutagen mutagen-io/mutagen/mutagen-compose && mutagen daemon stop && mutagen daemon start
```

## Next steps

To choose an installation mode, see [Choose an installation mode](/docs/dg/dev/set-up-spryker-locally/install-spryker/install/choose-an-installation-mode.html).

If you've already selected an installation mode, follow one of the guides below:

- [Install in Development mode on MacOS and Linux](/docs/dg/dev/set-up-spryker-locally/install-spryker/install/install-in-development-mode-on-macos-and-linux.html)
- [Install in Demo mode on MacOS and Linux](/docs/dg/dev/set-up-spryker-locally/install-spryker/install/install-in-demo-mode-on-macos-and-linux.html)
- [Integrating Docker into existing projects](/docs/dg/dev/upgrade-and-migrate/migrate-to-docker/migrate-to-docker.html)
