When running `docker-sync clean`, you might get two errors as described below.

## Error 1

You get an error similar to this one:

```bash
docker: Error response from daemon: Conflict. The container name "/data-sync" is already in use by container "47dd708a7a7f9550390432289bd85fe0e4491b080748fcbba7ddb3331de2c7e7". You have to remove (or rename) that container to be able to reuse that name.
```

## Solution

1. Run `docker-sync clean`.
2. Run `docker/sdk up` again.

## Error 2

You get an error similar to this one:

```bash
Unable to find image "eugenmayer/unison:hostsync_@.2' Locally
docker: Error response from daemon: manifest for eugenmayer/unison:hostsync_@.2 not found: manifest unknown: manifest unknown.
```

## Solution

Update docker-sync:

```bash
gem install docker-sync
```
