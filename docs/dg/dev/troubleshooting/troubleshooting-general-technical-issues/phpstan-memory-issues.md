## Cause

PHPStan needs to parse all files and because of Spryker's magic with resolving classesâ€“for example, `$this->getFacade()`, PHPStan needs to look up this class on its own when the `@method` annotation is missing.

## Solution

Run PHPStan in debug mode `--debug` on the module where it needs too much memory. In the debug mode, PHPStan will display the file name currently being analyzed. If PHPStan gets stuck at a specific file, look into this file and check if all `@method` annotations are present.
