Publish and Synchronization is slow on all or some actions.

## Cause

There are two possible causes for the slow Publish and Synchronization:

- All the Publish and Synchronization events go to the **event** message queue.

![an-event-message-queue](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/dev/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-performance-issues/slow-p-and-s/an-event-message-queue.png)

- Messages that are not used on the project.

## Solution

1. [Integrate multi-queue publish structure](/docs/dg/dev/integrate-and-configure/integrate-multi-queue-publish-structure.html).
The Publish action, in this case, can look like this:

![publish-action](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/dev/troubleshooting/troubleshooting-performance-issues/slow-p-and-s/publish-action.png)

2. Check and disable messages that are not used on the project.
