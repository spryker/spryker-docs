After you have completed the migration process, you need to prepare your project for going live.
Do the following:
1. Request the Go Live preparation: 8 weeks before your project goes live, create a ticket in [Spryker Support portal](https://support.spryker.com/) so Spryker can prepare everything for your smooth launching in SCCOS.
2. Prepare yourself for Go Live: Check out this [Preparation for going live list](/docs/ca/dev/preparation-for-going-live.html#eight-weeks-before-go-live) for details on preparations you need to make before going live.
