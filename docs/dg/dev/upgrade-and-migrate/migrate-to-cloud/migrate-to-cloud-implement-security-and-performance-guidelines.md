After you have [adapted the file system-based features](/docs/dg/dev/upgrade-and-migrate/migrate-to-cloud/migrate-to-cloud-adapt-the-filesystem-based-features.html), we highly recommend checking and eventually implementing the recommendations outlined in the [Security guidelines](/docs/dg/dev/guidelines/security-guidelines.html).
