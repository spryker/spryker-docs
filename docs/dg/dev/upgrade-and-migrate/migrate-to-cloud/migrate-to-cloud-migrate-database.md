After you have [chosen a multi-store setup](/docs/dg/dev/upgrade-and-migrate/migrate-to-cloud/migrate-to-cloud-choose-a-multi-store-setup.html), your next step is migrating your data to the database. For the database, Spryker SCCOS uses MariaDB. Therefore, you must migrate data in the MariaDB-compatible dump.

## Migrating MySQL or MariDB to MariaDB

To migrate the MySQL or MariaDB database to MariaDB in SCCOS, follow these steps.

1. Make sure the version of MySQL or MariaDB in the old system is compatible with the new Spryker Cloud system.
2. Run the following queries against the source DB and save this data. You'll need them later to validate that the restoration went successfully:

```php
<?php
$dbName = 'database_maria';
$db = new PDO("mysql:host=localhost;dbname=$dbName", 'root', 'password');
$tableNames = $db->query("SELECT TABLE_NAME FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = '" . $dbName . "'")->fetchAll(PDO::FETCH_ASSOC);
$tablesCount = count($tableNames);
foreach ($tableNames as $key => $tableName){
 $count = $db->query("SELECT count(*) as `count` from " . $tableName['TABLE_NAME'])->fetchColumn();
    file_put_contents($dbName . "-health-check.csv", $tableName['TABLE_NAME'] . "," . $count . PHP_EOL, FILE_APPEND);
    echo $tableName['TABLE_NAME'] . "," . $count . " - " . $key . "/" . $tablesCount . PHP_EOL;
}

```

3. Create a database snapshot like in this example:

```bash
mysqldump -u local_user \
    --databases database_name \
    --single-transaction \
    --compress \
    --order-by-primary  \
    --column-statistics=0 \
    -plocal_password | gzip > /path/to/outputfile.sql.gz
```

For additional information about this step, see [Importing data from a MariaDB or MySQL database to a MariaDB or MySQL DB instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/MySQL.Procedural.Importing.SmallExisting.html).
4. Upload the database dump to an AWS S3 bucket of the production environment using the AWS Management Console.
5. Connect to the EC2 instance. For details on how to do this, see [Create an Amazon EC2 instance and copy the compressed database](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/MySQL.Procedural.Importing.NonRDSRepl.html#MySQL.Procedural.Importing.Import.Database).

Optional: For the Spryker Cloud environment, we recommend using a Scheduler instance for backup/restore purposes. Do the following
* In AWS, go to **EC2 → Instances → <env_name>-<[/d/w]*> → Connect via Session Manager**
  ![Scheduler Container example](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/dev/migration-concepts/migrate-to-paas/scheduler-container-example.png)
* Copy the AWS credentials from here:
  ![AWS S3 credentials](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/scos/dev/migration-concepts/migrate-to-paas/aws-s3-credentials.png)
* Run the following command to copy the DB dump from S3 bucket to the Scheduler container:

```bash
sudo su
yum install mysql
cd /media
mkdir bkp && cd bkp
# Copy AWS credentials and paste here
aws s3 ls //to list buckets
aws s3 cp s3://<bucket_name>/<dump_name> .
```

6. In the AWS Management Console, go to **Parameter Store**.
7. To find the database credentials, filter the parameters by `DB`.
8. Restore snapshot to a new Spryker Cloud DB:

```bash
mysql -u<SPRYKER_DB_USERNAME> -p<SPRYKER_DB_PASSWORD> -h <Endpoint> <DB name> < <dump_name>.sql
```

9. Repeat step 2 against the restored database. To make sure the migration is successful, compare the outputs from the queries you've run for the original and for the restored DBs. They should be the same.

## PostgreSQL to MariaDB

PostgreSQL DB must be converted to MariaDB-compatible dump. You can migrate PostgreSQL DB to MariaDB using [AWS Database Migration Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Source.PostgreSQL.html). However, since this isn't something Spryker offers by default, if you want to implement this approach, you need to request the configuration additionally via [Spryker Support portal](https://support.spryker.com/).

After the migration, you can use the following queries to ensure that the data has been migrated consistently:

```sql
-- count entire database rows;
WITH tbl AS
  (SELECT table_schema,
          TABLE_NAME
   FROM information_schema.tables
   WHERE TABLE_NAME not like 'pg_%'
     AND table_schema in ('public'))
SELECT
       SUM((xpath('/row/c/text()', query_to_xml(format('select count(*) as c from %I.%I', table_schema, TABLE_NAME), FALSE, TRUE, '')))[1]::text::int) AS rows_n
FROM tbl
ORDER BY rows_n DESC;

-- count database rows per table;
WITH tbl AS
  (SELECT table_schema,
          TABLE_NAME
   FROM information_schema.tables
   WHERE TABLE_NAME not like 'pg_%'
     AND table_schema in ('public'))
SELECT table_schema,
       TABLE_NAME,
       (xpath('/row/c/text()', query_to_xml(format('select count(*) as c from %I.%I', table_schema, TABLE_NAME), FALSE, TRUE, '')))[1]::text::int AS rows_n
FROM tbl
ORDER BY rows_n DESC;
```
