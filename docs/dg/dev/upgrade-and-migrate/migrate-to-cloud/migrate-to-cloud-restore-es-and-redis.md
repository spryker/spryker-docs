After you have [defined the environment variables](/docs/dg/dev/upgrade-and-migrate/migrate-to-cloud/migrate-to-cloud-define-environment-variables.html), you must restore Elasticsearch and key-value store (Redis or Valkey).

Restoring key-value store (Redis or Valkey) and Elasticsearch on a newly deployed infrastructure can be approached in two ways. These approaches involve using the `sync:data` and `publish:trigger-events` commands.
We recommend using `sync:data`, because it directly synchronizes the database with Elasticsearch and key-value store (Redis or Valkey) without additional steps. However, if there are memory issues or any other complications with `sync:data`, you can use the alternative `publish:trigger-events` command. Keep in mind, though, that this command does extra work while republishing data in `_storage` and `_search` tables.

## The sync:data command

There is a default `vendor/bin/console sync:data` command in Spryker that lets you repopulate Elasticsearch and key-value store (Redis or Valkey) with the aggregated data from the database. This command must be executed during the migration process to restore Elasticsearch and key-value store (Redis or Valkey) data on a new Spryker Production environment.

Considering this fact, ensure that the `sync:data` command can restore your Elasticsearch and key-value store (Redis or Valkey) from scratch in a consistent and resilient way. This especially applies to custom `*Storage` and `*Search` modules, as they should have synchronization plugins implemented and enabled.

Because of the large data size, sometimes the command can't process all the records and fails. In this case, it can be executed per resource as follows:

```bash
console sync:data url
console sync:data product_concrete  
...
```

## The publish:trigger-events command

An alternative method for accomplishing this restoration is by using the `vendor/bin/console publish:trigger-events` command. This command republishes the aggregated data in the database for tables with names ending with `_search` and `_storage`. Additionally, it synchronizes this data with Elasticsearch and (Redis or Valkey). To ensure robustness, ensure that similar validation processes are conducted for `publish:trigger-events` as those performed for `sync:data`.
