In case if there are some third party services that can't be migrated to SCCOS for whatever reason, there is an opportunity to wire those to PaaS using VPN, AWS VPC Peering, AWS Private Link, etc.

If you need such connections, request them via the [Spryker Support Portal](https://support.spryker.com/).
