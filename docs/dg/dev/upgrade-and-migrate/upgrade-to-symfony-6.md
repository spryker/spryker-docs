Spryker primarily supports Symfony 6.4 that was released in December 2022. Backward compatibility remains for all three major Symfony versions, but support for Symfony 4 was partially dropped in October 2022.

{% info_block warningBox "Avoid old Symfony versions" %}

Although Spryker still supports older versions of Symfony, avoid installing them. Installing older versions of Symfony may cause conflicts with other packages that may have different requirements. Always try to keep your dependencies updated.

## Main changes in Symfony 6.4

Symfony 6.4 has a new cycle of innovations. When it starts, one cycle lasts two years, on a modernized codebase that has been cleaned up from the dead weight of the past.
The major change included in Symfony 6.4 is PHP 8.2 being the minimum required version of PHP.
The code of Symfony 6.4 has been updated. You can take advantage of all the new features in PHP.
For example, the code includes PHP 8 [attributes](https://www.php.net/manual/fr/language.attributes.overview.php), more expressive and rigorous type declarations, and more.

## Upgrade Symfony to version 6

To make your project compatible with Symfony 6.4, update the [Symfony](https://github.com/spryker/symfony) module and all modules that use it:

```bash
composer require spryker/symfony:"^3.11.0"
```

If you can't install the required version, check what else you need to update:

```bash
composer why-not spryker/symfony:3.11.0
```

This gives you a list of modules that require the latest `spryker/symfony` module and that need to be updated as well.
