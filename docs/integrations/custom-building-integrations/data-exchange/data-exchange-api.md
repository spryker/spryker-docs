Data Exchange API is a dynamic database API that facilitates data transfer in real-time, ensuring data is exchanged across all integrated platforms. It's part of the SCCOS platform core.

Data Exchange API lets you build, customize, and manage database APIs tailored to your specific business requirements through a user interface.

The main benefits of the Data Exchange API include the following:

- No coding is required: The API endpoints are created from the user interface.
- Rapid API generation: The APIs are generated within minutes.
- Flexibility and customization: You can tailor APIs to your needs. You can define parameters to ensure compatibility with your systems.
- Real-time updates: The infrastructure supports dynamic changes, so you can modify APIs on the fly.
- Security and Access Control: The infrastructure incorporates strong security measures and access controls, which safeguards sensitive information.

We recommend considering the Data Exchange API if you want to create your own data integration engine via API, without using any middleware software.
