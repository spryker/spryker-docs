The Client layer is a lightweight communication layer that connects the front end to storage, search, and the Zed back end. Because it already handles persistence (for example, Redis) and session management, it is the ideal place to isolate calls to thirdâ€‘party services.

- Place all HTTP or SDK calls in the Client layer.
- Expose clear, reusable methods so any other layer can call the integration.
