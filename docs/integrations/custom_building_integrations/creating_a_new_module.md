Spryker is built on a modular architecture, meaning every piece of functionality is encapsulated within its own self-contained module. Creating a new module allows you to introduce custom business logic or features while keeping your codebase clean, organized, and scalable.

When you create a module, you're building a reusable, decoupled component that can interact with other modules via clearly defined interfaces. This approach promotes separation of concerns and makes testing, maintenance, and future enhancements more manageable.

## Benefits of creating a new module

- Encapsulation of functionality: Keeps your logic isolated, making it easier to maintain and reuse.
- Better scalability: Modules can evolve independently without affecting unrelated parts of the system.
- Improved team collaboration: Teams can work on different modules simultaneously without conflicts.
- Alignment with Spryker standards: Ensures consistency and compatibility with the wider Spryker ecosystem.
