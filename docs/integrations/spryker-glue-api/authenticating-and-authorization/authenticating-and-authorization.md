Spryker APIs uses the OAuth 2.0 framework for authentication to secure its resources. On a technical level, this is handled by the Login API. To gain access to a protected resource, a client application must first obtain an access token. This token, a JSON Web Token (JWT), identifies the user in subsequent API calls and must be included in the request header.

### Access and refresh tokens

For security, access tokens have a limited lifespan. The default lifetime is **8 hours** (28,800 seconds). When an access token is issued, the response also includes a **refresh token**.

- Access Token: Used to authenticate requests to protected resources.
- Refresh Token: When an access token expires, the refresh token can be exchanged for a new access token and a new refresh token. The default lifetime for a refresh token is **1 month** (2,628,000 seconds).

It is recommended to revoke refresh tokens when they are no longer needed or if they become compromised. A revoked token is immediately marked as expired and cannot be used to obtain a new access token.


### Accessing protected resources

To make a request to a protected resource, you must pass the access token in the `Authorization` header.

**Example Request:**

```http
GET /carts HTTP/1.1
Host: mysprykershop.com:10001
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer eyJ0...
Cache-Control: no-cache
```

If the token is valid, the API will process the request. If authorization fails, the API returns a `401 Unauthorized` error with a code explaining the reason for the failure.

**Example Error Response:**

```json
{
    "errors": [
        {
            "detail": "Invalid access token.",
            "status": 401,
            "code": "001"
        }
    ]
}
```


### User and application types

Authentication grants access based on user type, and different endpoints may require different user roles. In the Spryker ecosystem, there is a distinction between the Storefront and Backend APIs.

- Storefront API: Used to authenticate a customer.
- Backend API: Used to authenticate a user (for example a company user or agent).

By default, you can authenticate as a customer, a company user, or an agent assist.

### Protected resources

Protected resources require authentication for interactions. To see which endpoints are protected in your specific implementation, refer to the API references where Swagger shows a lock icon for protected APIs:
