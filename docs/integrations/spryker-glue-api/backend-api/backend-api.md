<div class="content_box">

Backend API is designed for Admins and system-to-system communication. It is tailored for backend processes, administrative tools, and integrations with enterprise systems such as ERP or CRM. Technically it is multi-format, but out-of-the-box REST API is shipped.

</div>

## Key Features

- **Admin-focused**: Designed for administrative operations and back-office tasks
- **Multi-format support**: Technically supports multiple formats, with REST API shipped OOTB
- **Direct Facade access**: Direct access to Spryker's business logic layer (Facades)
- **High performance**: Optimized for performant backend operations
- **User authentication**: Uses Back Office user-based authentication
- **Enterprise integration**: Built for ERP, CRM, and other enterprise system integrations

## Use Cases

Backend API is ideal for:
- Administrative dashboards and back-office applications
- Enterprise system integrations (ERP, CRM, PIM)
- System-to-system communication
- Data synchronization and bulk operations
- Administrative automation and workflows
- Third-party management tools

## Getting Started

To start working with Backend API:

1. **Authentication**: Obtain Back Office user authentication tokens
2. **Explore endpoints**: Review available administrative API resources
3. **Implement requests**: Use appropriate format (REST API OOTB)
4. **Handle responses**: Process API responses according to format

## Data Exchange API

Backend API includes specialized Data Exchange API capabilities for:
- Bulk data operations
- Import/export functionality
- System synchronization
- Enterprise data integration

## API Reference

For detailed information about available endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication, see the [Backend API Reference](/docs/integrations/spryker-glue-api/backend-api/api-reference/).
