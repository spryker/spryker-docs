Spryker's API is a dedicated application layer within the Spryker Cloud Commerce OS. It's designed to provide API endpoints, process requests, and communicate with other parts of the system to manage data.  Think of it as the primary interface for any external system, custom frontend, or digital touchpoint that needs to interact with your Spryker-powered commerce platform.  Its main purpose is to enable headless commerce strategies, allowing you to build unique customer experiences and integrate seamlessly with a multitude of channels.

## Spryker API Types: Storefront API and Backend API

Spryker's API framework offers two primary types of API applications, each tailored for different use cases:

<div class="grid_container">
  <div class="content_card">
    <div class="content_column">
      <div class="content_icon">
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="content_column">
      <p class="content_title">Storefront API</p>
      <p class="content_text">Storefront API is designed for consumers and customer-facing integrations. It's the API layer that powers web shops, mobile apps, marketplaces, and other client-facing systems. It is based on REST API and follows JSON:API conventions.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="content_card">
    <div class="content_column">
      <div class="content_icon">
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="content_column">
      <p class="content_title">Backend API</p>
      <p class="content_text">Backend API is designed for admins and system-to-system communication. Tailored for backend processes, administrative tools, or integrations with enterprise systems, such as ERP or CRM. Technically it is multi-format, but REST API is shipped out-of-the-box. A key advantage is its direct access to Spryker's business logic layer (Facades).</p>
