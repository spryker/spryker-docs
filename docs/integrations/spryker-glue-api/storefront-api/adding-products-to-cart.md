The Storefront API provides comprehensive support for adding various types of products to shopping carts. This document covers the different product types and their specific requirements when adding them to cart via the `/carts/{cartId}/items` endpoint.

## Prerequisites

1. Authentication token: Obtain a customer cart access token via `/access-tokens` endpoint
2. Cart ID: Create a cart using `/carts` endpoint or use an existing cart
3. Product information: Know the product SKU and any additional attributes required for the specific product type

### Guest cart support

All product types described in this document can also be added to guest carts using the `/guest-carts/{guestCartId}/guest-cart-items` endpoint. Guest carts do not require authentication and follow the same request structure as authenticated carts. Main differences:

- No authentication token required
- Use guest cart ID instead of regular cart ID
- Guest cart endpoint: `/guest-carts/{guestCartId}/guest-cart-items`

## Basic cart item structure

All cart item requests follow this basic structure:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "type": "items",
        "attributes": {
            "sku": "product-sku",
            "quantity": 1
            // Additional attributes based on product type
        }
    }
}
```

## Product types

### Standard products

For basic concrete products without special configurations.

Request:

```http
POST /carts/{cartId}/items
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
Authorization: Bearer {access_token}
```

Body:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "type": "items",
        "attributes": {
            "sku": "123_456789",
            "quantity": 2
        }
    }
}
```

### Configurable products

Configurable products require additional configuration data through the `productConfigurationInstance` attribute.

Request:

```http
POST /carts/{cartId}/items?include=items
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json
Authorization: Bearer {access_token}
```

Body:

```json
{
    "data": {
        "type": "items",
        "attributes": {
            "sku": "configurable-product-sku",
            "quantity": 3,
            "productConfigurationInstance": {
                "displayData": "{\"Preferred time of the day\":\"Afternoon\",\"Date\":\"09.09.2050\"}",
                "configuration": "{\"time_of_day\":\"4\"}",
                "configuratorKey": "DATE_TIME_CONFIGURATOR",
                "isComplete": true,
                "quantity": 3,
                "availableQuantity": 4,
                "prices": [
                    {

                            "name": "Euro",
                            "symbol": "â‚¬"
                        },
                        "volumePrices": [
                            {
                                "netAmount": 150,
                                "grossAmount": 165,

                            }
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Products with random weight and measurement units

These products use sales units and measurement units for quantity specification.

            "sku": "random-weight-product-sku",
            "quantity": 1,
            "salesUnit": {
                "id": "sales-unit-id",
                "amount": 10
            }
        }
    }

## Common include parameters

Use these include parameters to get additional data in the response.

### Basic includes

- `items`: Cart items details
- `concrete-products`: Product information
- `sales-units`: Sales unit details for measurement products
- `product-measurement-units`: Measurement unit information
- `product-options`: Product option details

### Advanced includes

- `product-offers`: Product offer information (requires two-step include: `items,concrete-products,product-offers`)
- `merchants`: Merchant details for marketplace products
- `product-offer-prices`: Pricing information for product offers
- `product-offer-availabilities`: Availability data for product offers
- `configurable-bundle-templates`: Template information for configurable bundles
- `bundled-products`: Information about products within bundles

### Configurable products

For configurable products, the configuration data is included directly in the item attributes as `productConfigurationInstance`. No additional include parameter is needed for the configuration itself, but you can include the following:
- `concrete-products`: To get base product information
- `product-configuration-instances`: For detailed configuration metadata

### Example with multiple includes

```http
POST /carts/{cartId}/items?include=items,concrete-products,product-offers,merchants
```

This returns cart items with detailed product information, offer details, and merchant data in the `included` section of the response.
