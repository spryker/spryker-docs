Storefront API is designed for consumer-facing applications and external integrations, such as headless commerce. It is based on REST API and serves as the API layer that powers web shops, mobile apps, marketplaces, and other client-facing systems.

</div>

## Key Features

- **Consumer-focused**: Designed specifically for buyer journey and customer interactions
- **REST API based**: Follows REST conventions and JSON:API standards
- **Storage and Search access**: Direct access to Storage and Elasticsearch
- **RPC calls**: Makes RPC Zed calls using Clients
- **Customer authentication**: Uses customer-based authentication
- **Lightweight**: Optimized for performance in consumer-facing scenarios

## Use Cases

Storefront API is ideal for:
- Headless commerce implementations
- Mobile applications
- Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)
- Third-party integrations with customer-facing systems
- Marketplaces and multi-channel commerce
- Custom frontend implementations

## Getting Started

To start working with Storefront API:

1. **Authentication**: Obtain customer authentication tokens
2. **Explore endpoints**: Review available API resources
3. **Implement requests**: Use standard REST conventions
4. **Handle responses**: Process JSON:API formatted responses

## API Reference

For detailed information about available endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication, see the [Storefront API Reference](/docs/integrations/spryker-glue-api/storefront-api/api-reference/).
