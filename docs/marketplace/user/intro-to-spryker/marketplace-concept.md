An online *Marketplace* is a type of e-commerce business where products or services are sold and fulfilled by multiple sellers (*merchants*). The growing number of large companies are adopting the Marketplace business model to create new revenue streams, differentiate from the competition, get a better ROI, and increase customer loyalty by adding more products or services to their assortment.

The Spryker Marketplace solution supports two major types of marketplace models:

* *Pure Marketplace*: In such a marketplace, third-party merchants sell the products. The marketplace administrator manages the business process and makes money from commissions.

* *Enterprise Marketplace*: This type of marketplace is an organization with the existing e-commerce operations, which allows third-party merchants to sell through its platform to enrich offerings and stimulate growth. In such cases, both merchants and marketplace administrator act as sellers. 

The Spryker Marketplace solution supports both B2C and B2B marketplaces. Besides, Spryker Marketplace is not a separate system. Instead, it is built as a set of extensions on top of Spryker Commerce OS, which makes upgrading to Marketplace straight-forward and easy.
