This article describes the different types of users - personas, that function within the Marketplace.

A *Marketplace* is a type of e-commerce website where products or services are delivered and fulfilled by multiple sellers or *merchants* to the buyers, whereas transactions are processed by the Marketplace operator.

*Marketplace operator* is the company that owns the Marketplace. It can also sell on the marketplace as the [main merchant](/docs/marketplace/user/features/{{ page.version }}/marketplace-merchant-feature-overview/main-merchant-concept.html).
