## Data sources and datasets

This feature supports data from Spryker projects and third-party systems. When you set up Amazon QuickSight, the data from your project is available by default, and you can add other data sources if needed.

![QuickSight-datasets](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/pbc/all/business-intelligence/amazon-quicksight-third-party-integration/amazon-quicksight.md/qs-data-sets.png)

For more details on data sources, see [Supported data sources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/supported-data-sources.html).

### Extending project data for analytics

Datasets represent the data from your project that's available for analytics. By default, only the data that is secure and can be useful for analytics is available in datasets from respective database tables. For example, the Customer dataset doesn't include customer names or passwords.

You can extend the data available to datasets on the project level. For more details, see [Install Amazon QuickSight](/docs/pbc/all/business-intelligence/{{page.version}}/amazon-quicksight-third-party-integration/install-amazon-quicksight.html).


### SPICE data

SPICE (Super-fast, Parallel, In-memory Calculation Engine) is a robust in-memory engine used by Amazon QuickSight to calculate and serve data. All data in datasets is stored as SPICE data, which has the following advantages:

- Your analytical queries process faster.
- You don't need to wait for a direct query to process.
- Data stored in SPICE can be reused multiple times without incurring additional costs. If you use a data source that charges per query, you're charged for querying the data when you first create the dataset and later when you refresh the dataset.

You can check your SPICE storage capacity in the Back Office > **Analytics** > **Datasets** > **New dataset**.

For more details on SPICE data, see [Importing data into SPICE](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/spice.html).

### Refreshing data

To make datasets up to date, you need to refresh them by resyncing data from your project or third-party systems.

You can refresh data manually or automatically by setting up a schedule per data set. We recommend configuring an automatic refresh shortly after you set up Amazon QuickSight.


![refresh-dataset](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/pbc/all/business-intelligence/amazon-quicksight-third-party-integration/amazon-quicksight.md/refresh-dataset.png)

For instructions on refreshing data, see [Refresh analytics datasets](/docs/pbc/all/business-intelligence/{{page.version}}/amazon-quicksight-third-party-integration/back-office-refresh-analytics-datasets.html).


## Analyses and dashboards

In Amazon QuickSight, you are going to work with analyses and dashboards.

An analysis is a customizable visual representation of data. Using the provided tools, you can manipulate your data to extract and present the most important information.

Each analysis can contain multiple data visualizations, which can be rearranged and customized.


![QuickSight-analyses](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/pbc/all/business-intelligence/amazon-quicksight-third-party-integration/amazon-quicksight.md/qs-analysis.png)


A dashboard is a representation of data prepared in an analysis. It serves as a published version of data analysis, which can be shared with other users.

![QuickSight-dashboard](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/pbc/all/business-intelligence/amazon-quicksight-third-party-integration/amazon-quicksight.md/qs-dashboard.png)


Both analyses and dashboards are shareable, you can share a complete dashboard or collaborate on an analysis.

![QuickSight-sharing](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/pbc/all/business-intelligence/amazon-quicksight-third-party-integration/amazon-quicksight.md/qs-sharing.png)

You can share dashboards with authors and readers, and analyses â€“ only with authors.



## User management and permissions

User roles define what assets a user has access to, including the following:
- Analyses
- Dashboards
- Datasets
- Data sources

When working with analytics, users can have the following roles:
- Author: can view, create, and edit assets.
- Reader: can view dashboards.

The analytics roles are derived from Amazon QuickSight and are separate from the [Back Office user roles](/docs/pbc/all/user-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/manage-in-the-back-office/best-practices-manage-users-and-their-permissions-with-roles-and-groups.html).

The number of users with different roles depends on your contract.

<!-- To request new users or roles to be updated, contact your Customer Success Manager at [the analytics contact page](https://now.spryker.com/contact-analytics). -->

## Exporting data


When you need to share analytics data with users outside of Back Office, you can export individual visuals or whole analyses.

For instructions, see the following docs:

- [Exporting data from visuals](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/exporting-data.html)
- [Exporting Amazon QuickSight analyses or dashboards as PDFs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/export-dashboard-to-pdf.html)



## Resetting analytics


Sometimes you might want to start from scratch and get a fresh analytics account. Resetting analytics removes all assets and returns your account to the default state.

{% info_block warningBox %}

- Resetting Analytics returns all default assets, such as dashboards, analyses, and datasets, to their original state, erasing any changes you've made.
- The user performing the reset becomes the owner of the default assets, and all other users lose access to them.
- Custom assets created by other users remain under their ownership.
- Custom analyses will lose access to the default datasets. If the default datasets are used in custom analyses, duplicate the datasets and configure the analyses to use the copies. For instructions, see [Duplicating datasets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/duplicate-a-data-set.html).
