This document shows how to add a new shipment method without integrating it with the shipment provider system.

{% info_block infoBox "Note" %}

In this situation, you *must* have multi-currency prices attached to the shipment method and the correct tax set linked to it. Also, the `ship` event *must* be manually triggerable from the Back Office.

{% endinfo_block %}

## Set up the state machine

The state machine which handles orders using this shipment method needs to use a manual event for shipping so that it can be triggered from the Back Office.

The corresponding XML for this transition would be:

```xml
<states>
   <state name="exported" reserved="true"/>
   <state name="shipped" reserved="true"/>
//..
</states>
<transitions>
    <transition happy="true">
        <source>exported</source>
        <target>shipped</target>
        <event>ship</event>
    </transition>
//..
</transitions>
<events>
    <event name="ship" manual="true"/>
//..
</events>
```

3. To use this carrier company in the shop, select **Enabled**.
4. Click **Save**.

When you have a new shipment carrier, you can add a new shipment method to it.

The shipment methods with price are retrieved depending on your preconfigured price mode + current store and the selected currency.

Shipment methods can be excluded if their active flag is off. The connected `AvailabilityPlugin` plugin excludes them; otherwise, it has a price as NULL.

In this current example, the new shipment method is available in the shop for DE store, EUR currency, and gross price mode as 7 EUR.
