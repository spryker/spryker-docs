The *Resource Sharing* feature lets you generate a unique URL for any entity in Spryker. For example, you can generate a unique URL for a cart and share it with different access permissions.

For each entity, you must use an additional connector module. For example, to share carts, combine the Resource Sharing feature with the [Persistent Cart Sharing](/docs/pbc/all/cart-and-checkout/{{site.version}}/base-shop/feature-overviews/persistent-cart-sharing-feature-overview.html) feature.
