For example, *You should add items for {% raw %}{{{% endraw %}threshold{% raw %}}}{% endraw %} to pass a recommended threshold. You can't proceed with checkout.* <br><br> Enter {% raw %}{{{% endraw %}threshold{% raw %}}}{% endraw %} or {% raw %}{{{% endraw %}fee{% raw %}}}{% endraw %} to reference the threshold name or the defined fee respectively. When the message is rendered on the Storefront, the placeholders are replaced with the values from **Enter threshold value** and **Enter flexible fee** or **Enter fixed fee** fields. |
