The *Marketplace Cart* feature lets you include a "Notes" field on the cart page. Buyers can add notes to a particular item or the whole cart, for example, some special instructions about preparing and delivering an order.

Cart and item notes on the Storefront:

Item notes in the Merchant Portal:

The Marketplace administrator can see the special request in the [order details section of the Back Office](/docs/pbc/all/order-management-system/{{page.version}}/marketplace/manage-in-the-back-office/manage-main-merchant-orders.html#merchant-order-overview-page):

## Current constraints

In a situation where the same product variants are added to the cart with different notes, the variants get merged with the same note.
