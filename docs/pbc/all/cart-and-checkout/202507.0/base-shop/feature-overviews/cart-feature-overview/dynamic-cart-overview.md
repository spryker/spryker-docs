The dynamic cart functionality enables users to seamlessly manage their carts without reloading the Cart page. Users can perform actions like updating item quantity or adding cart notes without being redirected to the top of the page. This eliminates friction in the checkout experience and increases conversion rates. Additionally, giving customers immediate feedback on their cart actions without losing the context improves the user experience.

The following video shows how a user can interact with different elements of a cart without reloading the page.

## Cart validation and performance

On the cart page, the cart is validated when you open or refresh the page. Cart items are validated when you open the page, refresh it, or perform any actions that trigger a dynamic cart update. For projects that expect big numbers of cart items, such as in the B2B model, we recommend disabling cart item validation to improve performanece. Disabled cart item validation introduces a minimal risk of an item becoming unavailable as a customer finalizes their purchase, but enables more smooth interactions with the cart.

For instructions on disabling cart item validation, see [Install the Cart feature](/docs/pbc/all/cart-and-checkout/{{site.version}}/base-shop/install-and-upgrade/install-features/install-the-cart-feature.html).
