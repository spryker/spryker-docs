Spryker uses the `Calculation` module to calculate the cart totals that are displayed in the cart, during checkout, and when the order is placed.

The `Calculation` module extensively uses plugins to inject calculation algorithms.

## How Calculation works

{% info_block infoBox "Quote Transfer" %}

The quote transfer object is used to store data and plugins that calculate the amounts.

{% endinfo_block %}

There is already a list of plugins that populate quote transfer with corresponding data. Calculations are executed every time the content of the cart is updated.

{% info_block infoBox %}

For more details, check [Cart Data Flow](/docs/pbc/all/cart-and-checkout/{{site.version}}/base-shop/extend-and-customize/cart-module-reference-information.html#cart-data-flow) in the *Cart Functionality* section.

{% endinfo_block %}

If manual recalculation of cart is required, then `CalculationFacade::recalculate` can be called from Zed or `CalculationClient::recalculate` from Yves with prepared [Calculation Data Structure](/docs/pbc/all/cart-and-checkout/{{site.version}}/base-shop/extend-and-customize/calculation-data-structure.html). When the recalculation operation is called, the calculator runs the calculator plugin stack and each plugin modifies the `QuoteTransfer` (calculates discounts, adds sum gross prices, calculates taxes). Most plugins require the `unitGrossPrice` and the `quantity` to be provided.

{% info_block infoBox "Calculated amounts" %}

Each amount is calculated and stored in cents.

{% endinfo_block %}

## Calculator plugins

Calculator plugins are registered in the `CalculationDependencyProvider::getCalculatorStack()` method. This method can be extended on the project level, and the plugin stack can be updated with your own plugins. Each calculator must implement `CalculatorPluginInterface`.

For more information, see the following:

```php
<?php
interface CalculatorPluginInterface
{
    /**
     * @param QuoteTransfer $quoteTransfer
     *
    public function recalculate(QuoteTransfer $quoteTransfer);
}
```

- `RemoveTotalsCalculatorPlugin` resets quote totals, sets `TotalsTransfer` empty.
- `RemoveAllCalculatedDiscountsCalculatorPlugin` resets every `CalculatedDiscountTransfer`.
- `ItemGrossAmountsCalculatorPlugin` calculates `sumGrossPrice` for each `ItemTransfer`.

**`ItemTransfer::sumGrossPrice`** `= ItemTransfer::unitGrossPrice * ItemTransfer::quantity`

- `ProductOptionGrossSumCalculatorPlugin` calculates `unitGrossPriceWithProductOptions`, `sumGrossPriceWithProductOptions` for `ItemTransfer` and `sumGrossPrice` for `ProductOptionTransfer` calculates `unitGrossPriceWithProductOptions`, `sumGrossPriceWithProductOptions` for `ItemTransfer` and `sumGrossPrice` for `ProductOptionTransfer`.

```php
ProductOptionTransfer::sumGrossPrice = ProductOptionTransfer::unitGrossPrice * ProductOptionTransfer::quantity
ItemTransfer::unitGrossPriceWithProductOptions = sum(ProductOptionTransfer::unitGrossPrice) + ItemTransfer::unitGrossPrice
ItemTransfer::sumGrossPriceWithProductOptions = sum(ProductOptionTransfer::sumGrossPrice) + ItemTransfer:sumGrossPrice
```

- `SubtotalTotalsCalculatorPlugin` sums each of the `sumGrossPriceWithProductOptions` items.
`TotalsTransfer::subtotal = sum(ItemTransfer::sumGrossPriceWithProductOptions)`
- `ExpensesGrossSumAmountCalculatorPlugin` calculates `sumGrossPrice` for each item.
`ExpenseTransfer::sumGrossPrice = ExpenseTransfer::unitGrossPrice * ExpenseTransfer::quantity`
- `ExpenseTotalsCalculatorPlugin` calculates `expenseTotal` in `TotalsTransfer`.
`TotalsTransfer::expenseTotal = sum(ExpenseTransfer::sumGrossPrice)`
- `DiscountCalculatorPlugin` applies discounts to current `QuoteTransfer`, and each discountable item with the property `calculatedDiscounts` gets discounts filled. Also, `voucherDiscounts` and `cartRuleDiscounts` are populated with additional used discount data for order level.

{% info_block infoBox "Discount Calculation" %}

Discount calculation is a separate topic and is explained in the [Discount](/docs/pbc/all/discount-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/promotions-discounts-feature-overview.html) article.

{% endinfo_block %}


- `SumGrossCalculatedDiscountAmountCalculatorPlugin` calculates and sets `ItemTransfer` amounts after discounts to `sumGrossPriceWithProductOptionAndDiscountAmounts` and `unitGrossPriceWithProductOptionAndDiscountAmounts`; it also sets expense amounts after discounts to `unitGrossPriceWithDiscounts` and `sumGrossPriceWithDiscounts`.

```php
ItemTransfer::unitGrossPriceWithProductOptionAndDiscountAmounts = ItemTransfer::unitGrossPriceWithProductOptions - (sum(ItemTransfer:calculatedDiscounts::unitGrossPrice) + sum(ProductOptionTransfer::calculatedDiscounts::unitGrossPrice))
ItemTransfer::sumGrossPriceWithProductOptionAndDiscountAmounts = ItemTransfer::sumGrossPriceWithProductOptions - (sum(ItemTransfer:calculatedDiscounts::sumGrossPrice) + sum(ProductOptionTransfer::calculatedDiscounts::sumGrossPrice))
```

- `DiscountTotalsCalculatorPlugin` calculates the total for used discount and sets it to `totalDiscount` in `TotalsTransfer`. The sum of all discountable items `CalculatedDiscountTransfer` gross amounts is as follows:

```php
TotalsTransfer:discountTotal += sum(ItemTransfer::CalculateDiscountTransfer::sumGrossAmount +
ItemTransfer::ProductOptionTransfer::CalculateDiscountTransfer::sumGrossAmount + ExpenseTransfer::sumGrossAmount)
GrandTotalTotalsCalculatorPluginâ€”Calculates grandTotal in TotalsTransfer.
TotalsTransfer:grandTotal = TotalsTransfer::subtotal + TotalsTransfer:expenseTotal
```

- `GrandTotalWithDiscountsCalculatorPlugin` calculates `GrandTotal` after discounts in `TotalsTransfer`.
`TotalsTransfer:grandTotal = TotalsTransfer::subtotal + TotalsTransfer:expenseTotal - TotalsTransfer::discountTotal`
- `TaxTotalsCalculatorPlugin`calculates `taxTotal` and `taxRate` used from `TotalTransfer::grandTotal` and sets it in `TotalsTransfer::TaxTotalsTransfer`.

`TaxableItems = ItemTransfer, ProductOptionTransfer, ExpenseTransfer. TaxTotalsTransfer::taxRate = sum(TaxableItems) / TaxableItems TaxTotalsTransfer::taxAmount = round((TotalsTransfer::grandTotal * TaxTotalsTransfer::taxRate) / TaxTotalsTransfer::taxRate / 100)`
