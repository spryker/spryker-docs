Buyers can add simple products with one product variant to the cart directly from the Category page by clicking the **Add to cart** icon on the product card.

For the **Add to cart** icon to be active for the product on the **Catalog** page, the following criteria must be met:

- The product is an abstract with only one variant.
- The product is available.
- The product does not have [attributes](/docs/pbc/all/product-information-management/latest/base-shop/feature-overviews/product-feature-overview/product-attributes-overview.html).
- The product does not have [measurement](/docs/pbc/all/product-information-management/latest/base-shop/feature-overviews/measurement-units-feature-overview.html) or [packaging units](/docs/pbc/all/product-information-management/latest/base-shop/feature-overviews/packaging-units-feature-overview.html).

A product belonging to a [product group](/docs/pbc/all/product-information-management/latest/base-shop/feature-overviews/product-feature-overview/product-feature-overview.html) can also be added to the cart from the **Category** page. However, like with regular products, a product from the product group must have no more than one variant and be available.

If a product has [options](/docs/pbc/all/product-information-management/latest/base-shop/feature-overviews/product-options-feature-overview.html), it can be added to the cart from the Category page, but it's added without any options.
