The *Cart and Checkout* capability enables customers and guest users to create and manage multiple shopping carts. After filling a cart, they go through a multi-step checkout to fill in all the details and place an order.

The capability consists of a base shop and the marketplace addon. The base shop features are needed for running a regular shop in which your company is the only entity fulfilling orders. The marketplace features enable the support of multiple sellers in cart and checkout. To run a marketplace, the features from both the base shop and the marketplace addon are required.
