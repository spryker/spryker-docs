This document describes how to reorder product sets in the Back Office by defining weight. A product set's weight, relatively to other the other product sets' weight on a page defines how high it is on a page.

To reorder product sets by editing their weight, do the following:

1. Go to **Merchandising&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Product Sets**.
2. On the **Product Sets** page, click **Reorder Product Sets**.
    This opens the **Reorder Product Sets** page. The product sets are displayed in the ascending order of their current weight.
3. Change the **WEIGHT** of each product set, so that it is in the needed position relatively to the other product sets.
4. Click **Submit**.
    This opens the **Product Sets** page with a success message displayed. The updated **WEIGHT** is displayed in the list and the product sets are ordered according to it.
