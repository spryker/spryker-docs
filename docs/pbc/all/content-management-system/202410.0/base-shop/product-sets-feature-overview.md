The *Product Sets* feature lets you create and sell collections of products. For example, you can create a stationary workspace set, a set of clothing or accessories, or furniture for a specific room. The "Shop-the-Look" function is a common example of a product set, where you can build a collection of items based on relations or recommendations.

When browsing a product set, a Storefront user can select variants per product in a set, add an individual or all products from the set to cart.

A Back Office user can define the following:
- The order of products in a set displayed on the Storefront.
- The order of products sets displayed on the Storefront. It's relevant if you have multiple product sets on the same page.
- The unique product set URL.

A Back Office user can add product sets to any page by [creating a product set content item](/docs/pbc/all/content-management-system/{{page.version}}/base-shop/manage-in-the-back-office/content-items/create-banner-content-items.html) and [adding it to CMS pages and blocks](/docs/pbc/all/content-management-system/{{page.version}}/base-shop/manage-in-the-back-office/blocks/add-content-items-to-cms-blocks.html).

### Current constraints

The feature has the following functional constraints which are going to be resolved in the future:
- Product sets are shared across all the stores of a project.
- You cannot restrict availability of a product set to a store.
