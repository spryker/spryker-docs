A CMS page is an independent page of your shop, such as Terms and Conditions, About Us, or Contact Us.

To create a CMS page, follow the steps:

1. Go to **Content&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Pages**.
2. On the **Overview of CMS Pages**, click **Create page**.
3. On the **Create CMS Page** page, click the **General** tab.
4. Optional: To show the page in one or more stores, select the stores for **STORE RELATION**.
5. Optional: To make the page searchable on the web, select **IS SEARCHABLE**.
6. Select a **TEMPLATE**.
7. Optional: Select or enter **VALID FROM** and **VALID TO** dates.
8. Enter **NAME** and **URL** for each locale.
9. Click the **SEO** tab.
10. Optional: enter the following meta information:
- **META TITLE**
- **META KEYWORDS**
- **META DESCRIPTION**

11. To keep the changes, click **Save**.
    This opens the **Edit Placeholders: {PAGE_NAME}** page.
12. Add the needed content to the page.
13. To keep the changes, click **Save**.
  This refreshes the page with a success message displayed. The draft content is saved and you can return to this page later to edit the content or publish it on the Storefront.
14. Optional: To show the page on the Storefront, click **Publish**.
  This opens the **View CMS Page: {PAGE_NAME}** page with a success message displayed.

**Tips and tricks**

- If **IS SEARCHABLE** is selected, and no **STORE RELATION** is selected, the CMS page will not be displayed and will not be searchable.
- If **IS SEARCHABLE** is not selected, and one or more stores are selected for **STORE RELATION**, the CMS page will be shown but will not be searchable.
