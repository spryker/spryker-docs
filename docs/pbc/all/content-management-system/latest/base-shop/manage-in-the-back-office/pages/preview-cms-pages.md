This document describes how to preview CMS pages from the Back Office. This lets you see a page from a particular customer's point of view or preview a draft page.

## Prerequisites

1. [Assign a customer to your user](/docs/pbc/all/user-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/manage-in-the-back-office/manage-users/assign-and-deassign-customers-from-users.html).
2. On the Storefront, log in with the customer account you've assigned to your user.
3. Log into the Back Office with the account you've assigned the customer to.

## Preview a CMS page

1. In the Back Office, go to **Content&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Pages**.
2. On the **Overview of CMS Pages** page, click **View&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Preview**.
This opens the page in the preview mode.
