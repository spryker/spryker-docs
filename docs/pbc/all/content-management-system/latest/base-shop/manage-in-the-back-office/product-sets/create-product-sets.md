This document describes how to create product sets in the Back Office.

You create a product set to improve the customer's shopping experience. You collect similar products into a logical chunk that can be bought with a single click. Let's say you have a pen. The logically connected items to this product can be a pencil, notebook, and sticky notes. You can collect these products under a set named *Basic office supplies*. Instead of searching for each item, your customer will add this set to cart.

## Prerequisites

To start working with product sets, go to **Merchandising&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Product Sets**.

Review the [reference information](#reference-information-enter-general-information-for-the-product-set) before you start, or look up the necessary information as you go through the process.

## Create a product set

On the **Product Sets** page, click **Create Product Set** and follow the instructions in the following sections.

### 1. Enter general information for the product set

1. In the **General** tab, enter a **NAME**.
2. Enter a **URL**.
3. Optional: Enter a **DESCRIPTION**.
4. Enter a **PRODUCT SET KEY**.
5. Optional: Enter a **WEIGHT**.
6. To activate the product set after creating it, select **ACTIVE**.
7. Click **Next**.

### 2. Select products to add to the product set

1. In the **Products** tab, select checkboxes next to the products you want to add to the product set. Select at least two products.
2. Select **Next**.

### 3. Enter SEO information for the product set

1. On the **SEO** tab, enter the following for needed locales:
    - **TITLE**
    - **KEYWORDS**
    - **DESCRIPTION**
2. Click **Next**.

### 4. Add images for the product set

{% include scos/user/back-office-user-guides/add-images.md %} <!-- To edit, see /_includes/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/add-images.md -->

    This opens the **View Product Set** page with a success message displayed.
