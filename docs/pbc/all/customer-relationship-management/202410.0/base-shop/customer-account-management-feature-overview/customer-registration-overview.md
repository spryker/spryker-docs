In Spryker, customer registration is done by double opt-in. A double opt-in occurs when a user signs up, and an email with a registration confirmation link is sent to them. After they click the verification link, their account is activated, and they can start using the online store as registered customers.

{% info_block infoBox "Email verification" %}

There are multiple ways to register a customer. Regardless of how customers are registered, they always must verify their email addresses.

{% endinfo_block %}

## Registration flows

There are five customer registration options:

- Regular registration
- Checkout registration
- Registration by creating an account in the Back Office
- Registration by Glue API
- Registration by import

### Regular registration

The *regular registration* is the registration triggered from the registration page of the **My Account** page on the Storefront. It is a two-step process:

1. A customer fills out the registration form and selects **Sign Up**. A message about the email verification is displayed.  

2. The customer selects the verification link in the email and gets redirected to the login page, where the message about successful account activation is displayed.

### Checkout registration

*Checkout registration* is the registration triggered from the login checkout step. A customer adds products to the cart as a guest user and proceeds to checkout. At the login checkout step, they choose to sign up. Then, they follow the [regular registration](#regular-registration).

After checkout registration, the cart created by a customer as a guest user is converted into a registered user's cart and appears in the customer's list of carts.

### Registration by creating an account in the Back Office

A Back Office user can register a customer by entering customer account details. The verification email is sent to the email address specified by the Back Office user. Until the customer verifies their account using the link in the email, in the Back Office, the status of their account remains `Unverified`. Once they click the link, the status changes to `Verified`.

To learn how a Back Office user creates customer accounts, see [Creating customers](/docs/pbc/all/customer-relationship-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/manage-in-the-back-office/customers/create-customers.html).

### Registration using Glue API

A developer can register a customer by passing their customer account details using Glue API. The verification email is sent to the email address passed in the registration request. The customer activates the account by verifying their email address. Alternatively, a developer can verify the customer's email address using Glue API.

{% info_block infoBox "Verifying a customer's email address using Glue API" %}

A developer can verify a customer's email address using Glue API regardless of the way the account was created.

{% endinfo_block %}

To learn how a developer creates customer accounts using Glue API, see [Create a customer](/docs/pbc/all/customer-relationship-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/manage-using-glue-api/customers/glue-api-manage-customers.html).

To learn how a developer confirms a customer's email address, see [Confirming customer registration](/docs/pbc/all/identity-access-management/{{page.version}}/manage-using-glue-api/glue-api-confirm-customer-registration.html).

### Registration using import

A developer can register a customer by importing their customer account details. The verification email is sent to the email address specified in the import file. The customer activates the account by verifying their email address.
