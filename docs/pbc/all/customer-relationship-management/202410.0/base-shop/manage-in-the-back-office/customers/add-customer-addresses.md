This topic describes how to add customer addresses in the Back Office.

## Prerequisites

Review the [reference information](#reference-information-add-a-customer-address) before you start or look up the necessary information as you go through the process.

## Add a customer address

1. Go to **Customers&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Customers**.
    This opens the **Customers** page.
2. Next to the customer you want to add the address to, click **View**.
3. On the **View** page, click **Add new Address**.
4. On the **Add address** page, select a **SALUTATION**.
5. Enter a **FIRST NAME**.
6. Enter a **LAST NAME**.
7. For **ADDRESS LINE 1**, enter the address.
8. Optional: For **ADDRESS LINE 2** and **ADDRESS LINE 3**, enter any additional information for the address.
9. Enter a **CITY**.
10. Enter a **ZIP CODE**.
11. Select a **COUNTRY**.
12. Optional: Enter a **PHONE**.

**Tips and tricks**
The first address added is used for both billing and shipping. To use different addresses, add one more address for the customer and select billing and shipping addresses by [editing the customer](/docs/pbc/all/customer-relationship-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/manage-in-the-back-office/customers/edit-customers.html)
