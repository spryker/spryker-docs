In corporate environments, where users act as company representatives rather than private buyers, companies can leverage [Company Roles](/docs/pbc/all/customer-relationship-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/company-account-feature-overview/company-user-roles-and-permissions-overview.html) to distribute scopes and permissions among [Company Users](/docs/pbc/all/customer-relationship-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/company-account-feature-overview/company-accounts-overview.html). This endpoint allows retrieving information about the company roles.

## Installation

For detailed information on the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see [Install the Company account Glue API](/docs/pbc/all/customer-relationship-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/install-and-upgrade/install-glue-api/install-the-company-account-glue-api.html).
