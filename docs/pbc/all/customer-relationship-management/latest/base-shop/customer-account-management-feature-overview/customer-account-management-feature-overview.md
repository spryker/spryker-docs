The *Customer Account Management* feature enables a wide range of management options for customer accounts, as well as additional functionalities.

Customers create accounts to save their personal details. Back Office users manage the customer accounts: they can view and edit customer details, check orders, and add notes.  Customer accounts can have the following details:

- Contact details
- Addresses
- Order history
- Language and shipping preferences

Password management enables basic password security for customer accounts. It lets customers do the following:

- Specify the account password when registering.
- Change the password in their customer account.
- Request a password reset email.

Also, it lets you manage customer access, request a password change, or change it on your side. You can restrict the possibility for the customers to register with simple passwords and lock out accounts after several unsuccessful logins for a certain period of time.
