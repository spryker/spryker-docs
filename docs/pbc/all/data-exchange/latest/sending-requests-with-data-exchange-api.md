This document describes how to interact with databases using the Data Exchange API. The Data Exchange API lets you configure endpoints to interact with any database tables. In this document, `/dynamic-data/countries` is used to interact with the `spy_country` and `spy_tax_rate` tables as an example.

## Prerequisites

- [Install the Data Exchange API](/docs/pbc/all/data-exchange/latest/install-and-upgrade/install-the-data-exchange-api.html)
- [Configure the Data Exchange API](/docs/pbc/all/data-exchange/latest/configure-data-exchange-api.html)


The Data Exchange API is a non-resource-based API, and routes all specified endpoints directly to a controller. By default, all routes within the Data Exchange API are protected to ensure data security. To access the API, you need to obtain an access token by sending the `POST /token/` request with the appropriate credentials:

```bash
POST /token/ HTTP/1.1
Host: glue-backend.mysprykershop.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Accept: application/json
Content-Length: 67

grant_type=password&username={username}&password={password}
```

## Retrieve a collection of fields

To retrieve a collection of countries, you need to send the `GET https://glue.mysprykershop.com/dynamic-entity/countries` request. The request needs to include the necessary headers, such as Content-Type, Accept, and Authorization, with the access token provided.

Pagination allows for efficient data retrieval by specifying the desired range of results. To use pagination, include the desired page limit and offset in the request:

```bash
GET /dynamic-entity/countries?page[offset]=1&page[limit]=2 HTTP/1.1
Host: glue-backend.mysprykershop.com
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {your_token}
```

Response sample:

```json
{
  "data": [
      {
          "id_country": 2,
          "iso2_code": "AD",
          "iso3_code": "AND",
          "name": "Andorra",
          "postal_code_mandatory": true,
          "postal_code_regex": "AD\\d{3}"
      },
      {
          "id_country": 3,
          "iso2_code": "AE",
          "iso3_code": "ARE",
          "name": "United Arab Emirates",
          "postal_code_mandatory": false,
          "postal_code_regex": null
      }
  ]
}
```

The response contains all the columns from the `spy_country` table that are configured in `spy_dynamic_entity_definition.definition`. Each column is represented using the `fieldVisibleName` as the key, providing a comprehensive view of the table's data in the API response. By default, the API `GET` request returns up to 20 records.


Filtering enables targeted data retrieval, refining the response to match the specified criteria. To apply filtering to the results based on specific fields, include the appropriate filter parameter in the request:  

```bash
GET /dynamic-entity/countries?filter[country.iso2_code]=AA HTTP/1.1
Host: glue-backend.mysprykershop.com
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {your_token}
```

Response sample:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id_country": 1,
      "iso2_code": "AA",
      "iso3_code": "UUD",
      "name": "Create",
      "postal_code_mandatory": false,
      "postal_code_regex": null
    }
  ]
}
```

It is also possible to supply multiple values for a field. They are filtered as IN condition:

```bash
GET /dynamic-entity/countries?filter[country.iso2_code]={"in": ["AC","AD", "AE"]} HTTP/1.1
Host: glue-backend.mysprykershop.com
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {your_token}
```

Response sample:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id_country": 1,
      "iso2_code": "AC",
      "iso3_code": "ASC",
      "name": "Ascension Island",
      "postal_code_mandatory": false,
      "postal_code_regex": null
    },
    {
      "id_country": 2,
      "iso2_code": "AD",
      "iso3_code": "AND",
      "name": "Andorra",
      "postal_code_mandatory": true,
      "postal_code_regex": "AD\\d{3}"
    },
    {
      "id_country": 3,
      "iso2_code": "AE",
      "iso3_code": "ARE",
      "name": "United Arab Emirates",
      "postal_code_mandatory": false,
      "postal_code_regex": null
    }
  ]
}
```

{% info_block infoBox %}

When you combine multiple filters in a single request, the system applies an `AND` condition to the retrieved results.

{% endinfo_block %}

To retrieve a country by a specific ID, send a `GET` request with the following parameters:

```bash
GET /dynamic-entity/countries/3 HTTP/1.1
Host: glue-backend.mysprykershop.com
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {your_token}
```

Response sample:

```json
{
  "data":[
    {
      "id_country": 3,
      "iso2_code": "AE",
      "iso3_code": "ARE",
      "name": "United Arab Emirates",
      "postal_code_mandatory": false,
      "postal_code_regex": null
    }
  ]
}
```


If you send a request to an endpoint that's not configured in `spy_dynamic_entity_configuration`, the following is returned:

```json
[
    {
        "message": "Not found",
        "status": 404,
        "code": "007"
    }
]
```

### Retrieve a collection of entities together with relations

To retrieve a collection of countries with relations, you need to send the `GET https://glue.mysprykershop.com/dynamic-entity/countries?include=countryTaxRates` request.
The `include` parameter allows you to define a list of relations to be retrieved alongside the main entity of the request.
It follows this format `{mainEntity}?include={childRelationOfTheMainEntity.childRelationOfTheChildRelation},{secondRelationChain},{thirdRelationChain}`, where:
- The `include` parameter can consist of one or several relation chains, separated by commas (,).
- Each relation chain represents a series of relation names (see `spy_dynamic_entity_configuration_relation.name`) separated periods (.).
- Each relation in the relation chain represents a connection between two `spy_dynamic_entity_configuration` entities. See the `spy_dynamic_entity_configuration_relation` table structure.
- To be processed correctly, a relation chain must contain only existing relation names arranged in the correct sequence that aligns with the relation hierarchy. Otherwise, an error will be returned. See [error codes](#error-codes).

```bash
GET /dynamic-entity/countries?include=countryTaxRates HTTP/1.1
Host: glue-backend.mysprykershop.com
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {your_token}
```

Response sample:

```json
{
  "data": [
    "...",
    {
      "id_country": 14,
      "iso2_code": "AT",
      "iso3_code": "AUT",
      "name": "Austria",
      "postal_code_mandatory": true,
      "postal_code_regex": "\\d{4}",
      "countryTaxRates": [
        {
          "id_tax_rate": 1,
          "fk_country": 14,
          "name": "Austria Standard",
          "rate": "20.00"
        },
        {
          "id_tax_rate": 21,
          "fk_country": 14,
          "name": "Austria Reduced1",
          "rate": "13.00"
        },
        {
          "id_tax_rate": 22,
          "fk_country": 14,
          "name": "Austria Reduced2",
          "rate": "10.00"
        }
      ]
    },
    "..."
  ]
}
```

The response contains all columns from the `spy_country` table and the included `spy_tax_rate` table, as configured in `spy_dynamic_entity_definition.definition`. Each column is identified using the `fieldVisibleName` as the key, providing a comprehensive view of the table's data in the API response.

{% info_block infoBox %}

Currently (as of version 202404.0 and earlier), filters don't work with `relations` and are only used to filter the root entity results.

{% endinfo_block %}


## Sending `POST` requests

To create a collection of countries, submit the following HTTP request:

```bash
POST /dynamic-entity/countries HTTP/1.1
Host: glue-backend.mysprykershop.com
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {your_token}
Content-Length: 154

{
    "data": [
        {
            "iso2_code": "WA",
            "iso3_code": "WWA",
            "name": "FOO"
        }
    ]
}
```

The response payload includes all the specified fields from the request body, along with the ID of the created entity. Response sample:

```json
{
  "data":[
    {
      "iso2_code": "WA",
      "iso3_code": "WWA",
      "name": "FOO",
      "id_country": 257
    }
  ]
}
```


All fields included in the request payload are marked as `isCreatable: true` in the configuration. So, the API creates a new record with all the provided fields.
However, if any of the provided fields are configured as `isCreatable: false`, the request results in error.

For example, configure `isCreatable: false` for `iso3_code` and send the same request. You should receive the following error response:

```json
[
  {
    "message": "Modification of immutable field `countries[0].iso3_code` is prohibited.",
    "status": 400,
    "code": "1304"
  }
]
```


Certain database-specific configurations may result in issues independent of entity configurations. For example, with MariaDB, it's impossible to set the ID value for an auto-incremented field. Additionally, the `iso2_code` field in the `spy_country` table must have a unique value. Therefore, before creating a new record, you need to make sure you are not passing a duplicate value for this field. If a duplicate value is passed, the following is returned:

```json
[
    {
        "message": "Failed to persist the data for `countries[0].iso2_code`. Please verify the provided data and try again. Entry is duplicated.",
        "status": 400,
        "code": "1309"
    }
]
```

This response is caused by a caught Propel exception, specifically an integrity constraint violation: `(Integrity constraint violation: 1062 Duplicate entry 'WA' for key 'spy_country-iso2_code')`.



### Sending `PATCH` requests

To update a collection of countries, submit the following HTTP request:

```bash
PATCH /dynamic-entity/countries HTTP/1.1
Host: glue-backend.mysprykershop.com
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {your_token}
Content-Length: 174
{
    "data": [
        {
            "id_country": 1,
            "iso2_code": "WB",
            "iso3_code": "WWB",
            "name": "FOO"
        }
    ]
}
```

The response payload includes all the specified fields from the request body. Response sample:

```json
{
    "data":[
      {
        "iso2_code": "WB",
        "iso3_code": "WWB",
        "name": "FOO",
        "id_country": 1
      }
    ]
}
```


To update a specific country, send the following HTTP request:

```bash
PATCH /dynamic-entity/countries/1 HTTP/1.1
Host: glue-backend.mysprykershop.com
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {your_token}
Content-Length: 143
{
    "data": {
            "iso2_code": "WB",
            "iso3_code": "WWB",
            "name": "FOO"
        }
}
```

All fields included in the request payload are marked as `isCreatable: true` in the configuration. So, the API creates a new record with all the provided fields.
However, if any of the provided fields are configured as `isCreatable: false`, the request results in error.

For example, configure `isCreatable: false` for `iso3_code` and send the same request. You should receive the following error response:

```json
[
  {
    "message": "Modification of immutable field `countries[0].iso3_code` is prohibited.",
    "status": 400,
    "code": "1304"
  }
]
```



If `id_country` is not provided, the following is returned:

```json
[
  {
    "message": "Incomplete Request - missing identifier for `countries[0]`.",
    "status": 400,
    "code": "1310"
  }
]
```

If `id_country` is not found, the following is returned:

```json
[
  {
    "message": "The entity `countries[0]` could not be found in the database.",
    "status": 404,
    "code": "1303"
  }
]
```


{% info_block infoBox %}

Similarly to the `POST` request, it's important to consider database-specific configurations when sending a `PATCH` request.

{% endinfo_block %}

### Sending `PUT` request

When you send a PUT request, you provide the updated representation of the resource in the request payload. The server replaces the entire existing resource with the new representation provided. If the resource does not exist at the specified URL, the request creates a new resource.

To replace an existing entity, send the following `PUT` request:

```bash
PUT /dynamic-entity/countries HTTP/1.1
Host: glue-backend.mysprykershop.com
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {your_token}
Content-Length: 263
{
    "data": [
        {
            "id_country": 1,
            "iso2_code": "WB",
            "iso3_code": "WWB",
            "name": "FOO"
        }
    ]
}
```

The response payload includes all touched fields for the provided resource. Response sample:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "iso2_code": "WB",
      "iso3_code": "WWB",
      "name": "FOO",
      "postal_code_mandatory": null,
      "postal_code_regex": null,
      "id_country": 1
    }
  ]
}
```


It is also possible to send a `PUT` request for a specific ID instead of a collection using the following request:

```bash
PUT /dynamic-entity/countries/1 HTTP/1.1
Host: glue-backend.mysprykershop.com
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {your_token}
Content-Length: 143
{
    "data": {
            "iso2_code": "WB",
            "iso3_code": "WWB",
            "name": "FOO"
        }
}
```

{% info_block infoBox %}

When using `PUT` requests, it's important to consider that the same rules and configurations apply
as with `PATCH` and `POST` requests. This means that the `isEditable` attribute determines whether existing
items can be modified during a `PUT` request. Additionally, the `isCreatable` attribute is used for non-existing
items that are created automatically according to the `PUT` request RFC.

In technical terms, the `PUT` request follows the same guidelines as `PATCH` and `POST` requests in relation to
the definition and database-specific configurations. The `isEditable` attribute governs the update capability
of existing items during a `PUT` request, ensuring that only editable fields can be modified. Similarly, the `isCreatable`
attribute pertains to non-existing items and governs their automatic creation as part of the `PUT` request process,
adhering to the standards outlined in the `PUT` request RFC. It's crucial to adhere to these rules and configurations
to ensure accurate and consistent data manipulation during `PUT` operations.

{% endinfo_block %}

### Sending `DELETE` requests

By default, entities can't be deleted. To be able to delete an entity, in the configuration, set the `isDeletable` attribute for the entity to `true`. The configuration to delete entities isn't cascaded to child entities. Before you can delete an entity, you need to delete all of its child entities.

To delete a collection of countries, submit the following HTTP request:

```bash
DELETE /dynamic-entity/countries?filter[countries.iso2_code]={"in": ["UA","US","AL"]} HTTP/1.1
Host: glue-backend.mysprykershop.com
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {your_token}
```

The response should be `204 No Content`. If deletion is not allowed, `405 Method not allowed` is returned.


To delete a specific country, submit the following HTTP request:

```bash
PUT /dynamic-entity/countries/1 HTTP/1.1
Host: glue-backend.mysprykershop.com
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {your_token}
```

The response should be `204 No Content`. If deletion is not allowed, `405 Method not allowed` is returned.

### Sending `POST`, `PATCH` and `PUT` requests with relationships

To create or update an entity along with its related entities, you need to include the relationships directly in
the request payload. The payload should be structured to reflect the hierarchy and connections between the main entity
and its child entities.

{% info_block infoBox %}

Currently, our system doesn't support `many-to-many` relationships for POST, PATCH, and PUT requests.
Only `one-to-one` and `one-to-many` relationships are allowed. This means that each child entity can be associated
with only one parent entity.

{% endinfo_block %}

The payload for these requests follows a nested structure where the main entity and its related entities are included within a data array.
Each object in the data array represents an instance of the main entity, and each related entity is nested within it.

For correct processing, make sure that related entities are defined with existing relation names. Also, organize them in alignment with their hierarchical relationships in the database, corresponding to the relationships defined in tables like `spy_dynamic_entity_configuration_relation` and `spy_dynamic_entity_configuration_relation_field_mapping`:

- `spy_dynamic_entity_configuration_relation` specifies the relationships between parent and child entities. Each record links a parent entity to a child entity.
- `spy_dynamic_entity_configuration_relation_field_mapping` contains the field mappings between related entities.

The hierarchical relationships are primarily defined by the foreign key references in these tables.
For example, `spy_dynamic_entity_configuration_relation` uses foreign keys to establish connections between
parent and child configurations in `spy_dynamic_entity_configuration`.

Incorrect or non-existent relation names or a misalignment in the hierarchy leads to processing errors.
For a detailed list of potential errors, see [Error codes](#error-codes).

For POST, PATCH, and PUT requests the payload must accurately reflect the entity relationships.
Make sure that each entity in the request includes its corresponding related entities, structured as nested objects within the payload.

```bash
POST /dynamic-entity/countries HTTP/1.1
Host: glue-backend.mysprykershop.com
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {your_token}
Content-Length: 245

{
  "data": [
    {
      "iso2_code": "DE",
      "iso3_code": "DEU",
      "name": "Germany",
      "countryTaxRates": [
            {
                "name": "Germany Standard",
                "rate": "1.00"
            }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Response sample:

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "iso2_code": "DE",
      "iso3_code": "DEU",
      "name": "Germany",
      "postal_code_mandatory": null,
      "postal_code_regex": null,
      "id_country": 1,
      "countryTaxRates": [
            {
                "name": "Germany Standard",
                "rate": "1.00",
                "id_country_tax_rate": 1,
                "fk_country": 1
            }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The response contains all columns from the `spy_country` table and the included `spy_tax_rate` table,
as configured in `spy_dynamic_entity_definition.definition`. Each column is identified using the `fieldVisibleName`
as the key, providing a comprehensive view of the table's data in the API response.

{% info_block infoBox %}

For POST and PUT requests, which are used to create new entities, child entities receive their foreign key reference
to the parent entity only after the parent entity is created. The system automatically assigns the foreign key
to the child entities based on the newly created parent entity's ID.

{% endinfo_block %}

## Non-transactional saving

By default, the Data Exchange API uses a transactional approach to save data. If an error occurs during the saving process, the entire transaction is rolled back, and no data is saved. However, in some cases, you may want to save data non-transactionally. In the non-transactional mode, the API wraps each entity and its related records (if present in the request) in a separate transaction.

To enable the non-transactional behavior, you need to set the `X-Is-Transactional` with the value `false` in the request.
In the following example, the first entity will be saved successfully, while the second entity won't be saved because of the missing `rate` field.


```bash
POST /dynamic-entity/countries HTTP/1.1
Host: glue-backend.mysprykershop.com
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Bearer {your_token}
X-Is-Transactional: false
Content-Length: 445

{
  "data": [
    {
      "iso2_code": "DE",
      "iso3_code": "DEU",
      "name": "Germany",
      "countryTaxRates": [
            {
                "name": "Germany Standard",
                "rate": "1.00"
            }
      ]
    },
    {
      "iso2_code": "DE",
      "iso3_code": "DEU",
      "name": "Germany",
      "countryTaxRates": [
            {
                "name": "Entity without a rate"
            }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```


Because of the non-transactional mode, the user will receive a response with the saved entity in the `data` field and an error message in the `error` field.

```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "iso2_code": "DE",
            "iso3_code": "DEU",
            "name": "Germany",
            "id_country": 260,
            "postal_code_mandatory": false,
            "postal_code_regex": null,
            "countryTaxRates": [
                {
                    "name": "Germany Standard",
                    "rate": "1.00",
                    "fk_country": 260,
                    "id_tax_rate": 43
                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "errors": [
        {
