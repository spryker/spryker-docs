Discount Management lets you manage different kinds of discounts, such as cart rules and vouchers.

The capability consists of a base shop and the marketplace addon. The base shop features are needed for running a regular shop in which discounts are issues only for regular products. The marketplace features provide additional configuration options that let you create discounts for product offers. To run a marketplace, the features from both the base shop and the marketplace addon are required.
