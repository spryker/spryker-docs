[Gift Card](/docs/pbc/all/gift-cards/{{site.version}}/gift-cards.html) is an alternative payment method. It is purchased as a default product in the Spryker Commerce OS and is redeemed as a voucher code during the checkout. When you have a gift card code, this code can be applied to a shopping cart, and the money value of the applied gift card is deducted from the total sum of the cart items.

In your development, Gift Cards API provides resources for purchasing and redeeming gift cards in Spryker Commerce OS via Glue API.

This article includes a list of endpoints to manage Gift Cards for registered users.

{% info_block infoBox "Info" %}

To manage the gift cards of the unregistered users, see [Managing Gift Cards of Guest Users](/docs/pbc/all/gift-cards/{{site.version}}/manage-using-glue-api/glue-api-manage-gift-cards-of-guest-users.html).

{% endinfo_block %}

## Installation

For detailed information on the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see Gift Cards API Integration.

## Purchasing a gift card

Gift Card is available in the Spryker shop as an abstract product with its variants (concrete products). To purchase the gift card:

1. Add a Gift Card to a guest shopping cart. See [Adding Items to Carts of Registered Users](/docs/pbc/all/cart-and-checkout/{{page.version}}/base-shop/manage-using-glue-api/manage-carts-of-registered-users/glue-api-manage-items-in-carts-of-registered-users.html#add-an-item-to-a-registered-users-cart) for more details.
2. [Submit the checkout data](/docs/pbc/all/cart-and-checkout/{{page.version}}/base-shop/manage-using-glue-api/check-out/glue-api-submit-checkout-data.html).
3. [Complete the checkout](/docs/pbc/all/cart-and-checkout/{{page.version}}/base-shop/manage-using-glue-api/check-out/glue-api-check-out-purchases.html#place-an-order).

{% info_block warningBox "Note" %}

To prevent fraud, the payment method _invoice_ is not accepted if a cart contains a gift card.

{% endinfo_block %}

After placing the order, you will receive the gift card code to the email address specified in the checkout. You can redeem this code to pay for the products.

## Redeem the gift card code

To redeem the gift card code, send the request:

***
`POST` **/carts/*{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}cart_uuid{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}*/cart-codes?include=vouchers,gift-cards**
***

| PATH PARAMETER | DESCRIPTION |
