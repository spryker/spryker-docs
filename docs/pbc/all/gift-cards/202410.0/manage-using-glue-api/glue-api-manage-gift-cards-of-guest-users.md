[Gift card](/docs/pbc/all/gift-cards/{{site.version}}/gift-cards.html) is an alternative payment method. It is purchased as a regular product in the Spryker Commerce OS and is redeemed as a voucher code during checkout. When you apply the code of a gift card to a shopping cart, the money value of the gift card is deducted from the total sum of the cart items.

In your development, Gift Cards API provides resources for purchasing and redeeming gift cards.

This endpoint allows managing gift cards of guest users.

To manage the gift cards of the registered users, see [Managing gift cards of registered users](/docs/pbc/all/gift-cards/{{site.version}}/manage-using-glue-api/glue-api-manage-gift-cards-of-registered-users.html).

## Installation

For detailed information on the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see [Gift Cards API feature integration](/docs/pbc/all/gift-cards/{{site.version}}/install-and-upgrade/install-the-gift-cards-feature.html).

## Purchasing a gift card

You can purchase a gift card as a regular product. To do that:

1. Add a gift card to a guest cart. See [Add an item to a guest cart](/docs/pbc/all/cart-and-checkout/{{page.version}}/base-shop/manage-using-glue-api/manage-guest-carts/glue-api-manage-guest-cart-items.html#add-items-to-a-guest-cart) for more details.
2. [Submit the checkout data](/docs/pbc/all/cart-and-checkout/{{page.version}}/base-shop/manage-using-glue-api/check-out/glue-api-submit-checkout-data.html#submit-checkout-data).
3. [Place the order](/docs/pbc/all/cart-and-checkout/{{page.version}}/base-shop/manage-using-glue-api/check-out/glue-api-check-out-purchases.html#place-an-order).

After placing the order, you receive the gift card code to the email address specified in the checkout. You can redeem this code to pay for the products.


## Redeem a gift card in a guest cart

To redeem a gift card, send the request:

***
`POST` **/guest-carts/*{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}guest_cart_uuid{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}*/cart-codes?include=vouchers,gift-cards**
