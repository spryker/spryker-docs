After a customer has been created (to create a customer, see [Customers](/docs/pbc/all/customer-relationship-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/manage-using-glue-api/customers/glue-api-manage-customers.html)), the registration must be confirmed. This endpoint allows you to do that by sending a confirmation code received by email.

## Installation

For detailed information on the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see [Install the Customer Account Management feature](/docs/pbc/all/customer-relationship-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/install-and-upgrade/install-features/install-the-customer-account-management-feature.html).

## Confirm customer registration

To confirm customer registration, send the request:

***
`POST` **/customer-confirmation**
***

### Request

Request sample: confirm customer registration

`POST` **/customer-confirmation**

```json
{
  "data" : {
     "type": "customer-confirmation",
     "attributes": {
            "registrationKey": "e13ec2a7c45c6d1bae9b266ed90dfff0"
        }
    }
}
```

| ATTRIBUTE | TYPE | REQUIRED | DESCRIPTION |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| registrationKey | String | âœ“ | Customer's registration key. You can get it from the link in the customer confirmation registration email sent after customer creation. The example link: `https://mysprykershop.com/register/confirm?token=e13ec2a7c45c6d1bae9b266ed90dfff0`, where `e13ec2a7c45c6d1bae9b266ed90dfff0` is the registration key. |

### Response

If the customer email is confirmed successfully, the endpoint returns the `204 No Content` status code.

## Possible errors

| CODE| REASON |
| --- | --- |
| 423 | Confirmation code is invalid or has been already used. |
