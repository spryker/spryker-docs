After creating a customer, users receive a verification email. The email contains a link with the token that confirms and finalizes the customer registration process. Customers click the verification link from the email and finish the registration. Alternatively, you can confirm the customer registration via API (see [Confirming customer registration](/docs/pbc/all/identity-access-management/{{page.version}}/manage-using-glue-api/glue-api-confirm-customer-registration.html)). After confirmation, you can authenticate as a customer to perform requests to the protected resources.
