To manage merchant relations, go to **B2B Contracts -> Merchant Relations**. Click the relation you want to manage.

To edit a merchant relation:

1. Optional: In *Business Units*, clear the checkboxes for the business units you want to remove from this relation and click **Save**.
2. Optional: In *Internal comments*, leave notes for your colleagues. Buyers won’t see these comments.

You can also delete a merchant relation. Deletion removes the merchant relation from the Merchant Portal, the Back Office, and from the buyer’s Storefront. To delete a merchant relation, click **Delete** and confirm deletion.
