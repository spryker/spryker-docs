This document describes how to create merchants in the Back Office.


{% info_block infoBox "" %}

In a non-marketplace environment:
- In B2B: Multiple merchants may exist, representing different companies selling goods.
- In B2C: There are no merchants, as the system is focused on direct sales from the business to the consumer.

{% endinfo_block %}
