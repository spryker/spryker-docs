By using the 'Merchant Opening Hours' feature, merchants can save their opening hours in the system and make them accessible to customers. A merchant may have a weekday schedule, which is an opening schedule for every day of the week, as well as date-based exceptions, such as during the holiday season when opening hours may be different.
