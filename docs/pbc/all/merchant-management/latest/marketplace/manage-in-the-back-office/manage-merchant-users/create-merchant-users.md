A [merchant user](/docs/pbc/all/merchant-management/latest/marketplace/marketplace-merchant-feature-overview/merchant-users-overview.html) is a user that performs tasks on behalf of a merchant in the Merchant Portal. To create a merchant user in the Back Office, follow the steps:

1. Go to **Marketplace&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Merchants**.
2. Next to the merchant you want to create a merchant user for, click **Edit**.
    This opens the **Edit Merchant: {Merchant_ID}** page.
3. Click the **Users** tab.
4. Click **Add Merchant User**.
5. On the **CREATE MERCHANT USER** page, enter the following details:
- **E-MAIL**
- **FIRST NAME**
- **LAST NAME**  
6. Click **Create**.
    This opens the **Edit Merchant: {MERCHANT_ID}** page with a success message displayed. The merchant user is displayed in the list.

7. Optional: Activate the merchant user by clicking **Activate** next to it.
    This refreshes the page with a success message displayed. A password reset email has been sent to the user's email address. After resetting the password, the user can log into the Merchant Portal.
