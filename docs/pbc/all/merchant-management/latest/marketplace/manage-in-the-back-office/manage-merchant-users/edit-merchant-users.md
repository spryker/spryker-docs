A [merchant user](/docs/pbc/all/merchant-management/{{page.version}}/marketplace/marketplace-merchant-feature-overview/merchant-users-overview.html) is a user that performs tasks on behalf of a merchant in the Merchant Portal. To edit a merchant user in the Back Office, follow the steps:

1. Go to **Marketplace&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Merchants**.

2. Next to the merchant you want to edit a merchant user for, click **Edit**.
    This opens the **Edit Merchant: {Merchant_ID}** page.

3. Click the **Users** tab.

4. Next to the merchant user you want to edit, click **Edit**.

5. On the **Edit Merchant user** page, enter any of the following:
- **E-MAIL**
- **FIRST NAME**
- **LAST NAME**

6. Select a **STATUS**.

7. Click **Save**
    This opens the **Edit Merchant: {MERCHANT_ID}** page with a success message displayed. The merchant user is displayed in the list.
