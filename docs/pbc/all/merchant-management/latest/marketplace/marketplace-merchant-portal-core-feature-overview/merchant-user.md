This document provides a short overview of Merchant User concept in the Spryker Marketplace.

## Merchant User structure

`MerchantUser` module is the source of users for the Merchant Portal. `MerchantUserFacade` should be used to perform all operations on users, including but not limited to:
- Create, update, delete, and disable merchant users.
- Obtaining information about existing merchant users.
- Obtaining data about the current logged in merchant user.
- Authentication of merchant users.
- Manipulation of passwords (reset, validation).

Merchant users are activated and deactivated when their Merchant is activated or deactivated. `SyncMerchantUsersStatusMerchantPostUpdatePlugin` takes care of it.


## Merchant User relations

{% info_block errorBox %}

To avoid technical debt in the future, never use `UserFacade` directly in Merchant Portal modules.

The following diagram illustrates merchant user relations:
