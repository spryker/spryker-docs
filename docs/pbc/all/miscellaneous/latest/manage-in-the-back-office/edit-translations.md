2. On the **Glossary** page, next to the translation you want to edit, click **Edit**.

    This opens the **Glossary** page with a success message displayed.
5. Ask your development team to apply the changes on the code level.

## Reference information: NAME

A **NAME** of a translation is a glossary key, a unique identifier of the translation. You use it to add translations to different types of content. When the content is rendered on the Storefront, the glossary key is replaced with a translation based on selected locale and the translation you entered for the locale.
