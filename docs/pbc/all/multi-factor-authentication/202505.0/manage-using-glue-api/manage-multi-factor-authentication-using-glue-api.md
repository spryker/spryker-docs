This section explains how to activate, deactivate, and use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) when sending requests to protected resources using Glue API.

To learn more about MFA methods, see [Multi-Factor Authentication feature overview](/docs/pbc/all/multi-factor-authentication/{{page.version}}/multi-factor-authentication.html).

We use the email authentication method as an example. If you're implementing other MFA types, adapt the type field in the request payloads accordingly.


## Installation

[Install the Multi-Factor Authentication feature](/docs/pbc/all/multi-factor-authentication/{{page.version}}/install-multi-factor-authentication-feature.html)
[Install Customer Email Multi-Factor Authentication method](/docs/pbc/all/multi-factor-authentication/{{page.version}}/install-customer-email-multi-factor-authentication-method.html)


Before you proceed, you need to know whether the user has any MFA methods configured, and whether those methods are enabled or not yet set up.




## 3) Authenticate Using MFA Before a Protected Action

If the user already has an active method, and they attempt a protected action, you must first trigger the MFA flow.





**Response**: 204 No Content â€” the MFA method has been deactivated.
