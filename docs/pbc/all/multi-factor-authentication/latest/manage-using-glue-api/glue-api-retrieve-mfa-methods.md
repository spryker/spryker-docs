This document describes how to retrieve available Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) methods. The endpoint also shows the status of each method for the user that requested them.

The email authentication method is used as an example. The endpoint supports all authentication methods implemented in your project.


## Installation

- [Install the Multi-Factor Authentication feature](/docs/pbc/all/multi-factor-authentication/latest/install-multi-factor-authentication-feature.html)
