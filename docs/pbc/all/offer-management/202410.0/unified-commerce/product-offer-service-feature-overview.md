The *Product Offer Service* feature lets you assign service point services to product offers. Multiple services can be assigned to a product offer as long as the services belong to the same service point.

To import the assignments of services to product offers, see [Import file details: product_offer_service.csv](/docs/pbc/all/offer-management/latest/unified-commerce/import-file-details-product-offer-service.csv.html).
