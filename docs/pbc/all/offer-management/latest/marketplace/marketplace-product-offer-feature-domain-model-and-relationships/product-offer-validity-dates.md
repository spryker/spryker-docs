Validity dates define the date range when a product offer is active. The Validity Dates entity manipulates the product offer activity field (`spy_product_offer.is_active`),
activating and deactivating it based on the validity date range.

To update the product offer activity by validity dates data, run:

```bash
console product-offer:check-validity
```
