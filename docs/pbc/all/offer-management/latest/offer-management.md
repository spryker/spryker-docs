The *Offer Management* capability consists only of a marketplace addon. It lets multiple merchants sell the same product by creating offers for it. For more information about offers, see [Marketplace Product Offer feature overview](/docs/pbc/all/offer-management/{{page.version}}/marketplace/marketplace-product-offer-feature-overview.html).
