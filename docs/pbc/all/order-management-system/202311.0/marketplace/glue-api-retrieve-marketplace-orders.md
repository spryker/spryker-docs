Every registered customer can retrieve the list of orders for their account, as well as the detailed order information, including every step of the calculation and addresses used in the orders.

In your development, this resource can help you to:

- Make the order history available to customers.
- Make order details available to enable reordering functionality.

The **Marketplace Order Management API** lets you retrieve all orders made by a registered customer.


## Installation

For detailed information about the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see [**Install the Order Management Glue API**](/docs/pbc/all/order-management-system/{{page.version}}/base-shop/install-and-upgrade/install-glue-api/install-the-order-management-glue-api.html)

## Retrieve all orders

To retrieve a list of all orders made by a registered customer, send the request:

***
`GET` **/orders**
