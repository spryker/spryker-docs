*My Orders* is a dedicated page for managing the orders that customers completed from the [main merchant](/docs/pbc/all/merchant-management/{{page.version}}/marketplace/marketplace-merchant-feature-overview/main-merchant.html) (Marketplace owner) within the Marketplace.

## Prerequisites

To start managing merchant orders for the [main merchant](/docs/pbc/all/merchant-management/{{page.version}}/marketplace/marketplace-merchant-feature-overview/main-merchant.html), navigate to **Sales&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> My orders**.

The instructions assume that there is an existing order with the *New* status.

Each section in this article contains reference information. Make sure to review it before you start, or look up the necessary information as you go through the process.

## Viewing main merchant orders

To view the [main merchant](/docs/pbc/all/merchant-management/{{page.version}}/marketplace/marketplace-merchant-feature-overview/main-merchant.html) orders, in the **List of Orders** table, click **View** next to the order you want to check.
This takes you to the **Merchant Order Overview** page.
