This document describes how to create returns in the Back Office.

If a sales order item is [returnable](/docs/pbc/all/return-management/{{page.version}}/marketplace/marketplace-return-management-feature-overview.html), you can create a return for it. On the Storefront, only registered users can create returns. In the Back Office, you can create returns for both the registered and guest users.

## Prerequisites

You can create returns for the items that are in **Exported** or **Delivered** states only. To learn how to change item states, see [Changing the state of order items](/docs/pbc/all/order-management-system/{{page.version}}/base-shop/manage-in-the-back-office/orders/change-the-state-of-order-items.html).

To start managing orders, go to **Sales&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Orders**.

## Creating returns

1. On the **Orders** page, next to the order you want to return, click **View**.
2. On the **Order Overview** page, click **Return**.
3. On the **Create Return** page, select the items that are to be returned.

{% info_block warningBox "Returning bundles" %}

You can only return separate items in a [configurable bundle](/docs/pbc/all/product-information-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/feature-overviews/configurable-bundle-feature-overview.html), not the bundle itself.

You can return [product bundles](/docs/pbc/all/product-information-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/feature-overviews/product-bundles-feature-overview.html) only as a single item.

{% endinfo_block %}

4. Optional: For **Select reason**, select a reason for returning the items.
5. Click **Create return**.
    This creates the return and opens the **Return Overview** page.
