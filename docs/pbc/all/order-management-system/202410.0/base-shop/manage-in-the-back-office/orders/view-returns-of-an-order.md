This document describes how to view returns of an order in the Back Office.

## Prerequisites

To start working with orders, go to **Sales&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Orders**.

Review the [reference information](#reference-information-viewing-returns-of-an-order) before you start, or look up the necessary information as you go through the process.

## Viewing returns of an order

1. On the **Orders** page, next to the order you want to view the returns of, click **View**.
    This opens the **Order Overview** page.
2. In the **RETURNS** pane, next to the return you want to view, click **View**.
    This opens the **Overview of Return: [Return ID]** page. To learn what you can do with returns, see [Managing returns](/docs/pbc/all/return-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/manage-in-the-back-office/manage-returns.html).
