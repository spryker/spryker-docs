The Spryker State Machine allows you to easily implement complex processes and map out business workflows.Â Instead of writing code for every process or adapting standard functionality, Spryker State Machine lets you model the order process with states and transitions.

For example, you can define one state machine to manage orders that use a credit card payment type, and a separate state machine for orders that use invoices.

A feature heavily utilized by Spryker customers, a state machine translates a variety of business needs into a coherent IT structure.

This section explains state machine fundamentals and how to model a state machine.
