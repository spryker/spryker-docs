In the marketplace, when a buyer goes through checkout, the [Marketplace order](/docs/pbc/all/order-management-system/{{page.version}}/marketplace/marketplace-order-management-feature-overview/marketplace-order-management-feature-overview.html) is created. Such an order can contain offers and products from different merchants. The part of the order that belongs to a certain merchant is called *merchant order*. The merchant order created in the system after the Marketplace order has been placed. Thus, each merchant order contains at least one item from the Marketplace order.

## Merchant order calculation

A merchant order consists of merchant order items, which are items (products) purchased by a customer. All the calculations for merchant order items are performed using the product offer, merchant products price, and *merchant order totals*. These are the [initial totals](/docs/pbc/all/cart-and-checkout/{{page.version}}/base-shop/extend-and-customize/calculation-3-0.html) that are calculated according to the product offer purchased:

| TOTAL | DESCRIPTION |
| -------- | -------------- |
| Canceled total   | Amount to be returned in case the order was canceled. `Canceled total = Merchant Order grand total - Merchant Order expense total` |
| Discount total  | Total discount amount.    |
| Merchant Order grand total   | Total amount the customer needs to pay after the discounts have been applied. |
| Merchant Order expense total  | Total expenses amount (for example, shipping).   |
| Merchant Order refund total  | Total refundable amount.   |
| Merchant Order subtotal  | Total amount before taxes and discounts.  |
| Merchant Order tax total  | Total tax amount from the grand total.   |
| Marketplace Operator fees total | Total amount of fees paid to the Marketplace administrator.  |

The rounding logic for the calculations is the same as the one used for the Marketplace order. For details, see [Rounding in the Marketplace Order feature overview](/docs/pbc/all/order-management-system/{{page.version}}/marketplace/marketplace-order-management-feature-overview/marketplace-order-management-feature-overview.html#rounding).
