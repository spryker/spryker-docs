Sometimes payment service providers do not support multiple shipments for the same order, which contradicts the essence of the [Split Delivery feature](/docs/pbc/all/order-management-system/{{page.version}}/base-shop/order-management-feature-overview/split-delivery-overview.html). In this case, you can disable the Split Delivery feature in the Checkout process; however, it will still work in the Back Office.

To disable the feature for the Checkout process in Yves, do the following:
1. Open the `\Pyz\Shared\Shipment\ShipmentConfig.php` file.
2. Change the `isMultiShipmentSelectionEnabled()` to `return false`:

```php
<?php

/**
 * This file is part of the Spryker Suite.
 * For full license information, view the LICENSE file that was distributed with this source code.
 */

namespace Pyz\Shared\Shipment;

use Spryker\Shared\Shipment\ShipmentConfig as SprykerShipmentConfig;

class ShipmentConfig extends SprykerShipmentConfig
{
   /**
    * @return bool
    */
    public function isMultiShipmentSelectionEnabled(): bool
    {
        return false;
    }
}
```

3. Save your changes.
