The Sales module provides the order management functionality. The functionality is obtained through the ZED UI that renders orders with orders details and the Client API to get customer orders.

## Getting totals for order

To get the Order with totals, the facade method `SalesFacade::getOrderByIdSalesOrder()` creates an order level which returns the OrderTransfer with a hydrated grandTotal, subtotal, expense, discounts, and more.

This is an improvement from the Sales 5.0 version where you had to use `SalesAggregatorFacade` to get totals. This version has been deprecated.

{% endinfo_block %}


## Persisting order calculated values

All calculated values are persisted now, when order are first placed. The values are stored by orderSaver plugins from checkout bundle. Check `/Pyz/Zed/Checkout/CheckoutDependencyProvider::getCheckoutOrderSavers` for currently available plugins.

Some values can change during time when order refunded or partially refunded, with `canceled_amount` and `refundable_amount` being recalculated and new values  persisted. At the same time, totals also change, but they do not overwrite old entry. Instead, it creates a new row in `spy_sales_order_total`. With this, you have a history of order totals from the time order was placed.

The following ER diagram shows persisted calculated values:

## Extension points

HydrateOrderPluginInterface—this is an action which happens when the `SalesFacade::getOrderByIdSalesOrder()` method is called. This can be done when you wish to populate `OrderTransfer` with additional data. This plugins accepts passes `OrderTransfer` for additional population.

There are already few plugins provided:

- `DiscountOrderHydratePlugin`—populates `OrderTransfer` with discount related data as it was stored when order is placed.
- `ProductOptionOrderHydratePlugin`—populates `OrderTransfer` with product option related data.
- `ProductBundleOrderHydratePlugin`—populates `OrderTransfer` with product bundle related data.
- `ShipmentOrderHydratePlugin`—populates `OrderTransfer` with shipment related data.
