This document describes how to create shipments for orders in the Back Office.

## Prerequisites

To start working with order shipments, do the following:

1. Go to **Sales&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Orders**.
2. Next to the order you want to manage the shipment of, click **View**.
    This opens the **Order Overview** page.

Review the [reference information](#reference-information-creating-shipments) before you start, or look up the necessary information as you go through the process.

{% info_block warningBox %}

If you create or edit a shipment of an order created by a customer, the grand total paid by the customer is not affected:

- If a new shipment method is added, its price is 0.
- If the shipment method is changed, the price of the previous shipment method is displayed.

{% endinfo_block %}

## Creating shipments

If you have more than one item in an order, you can create a new shipment as follows:

1. In the **ORDER ITEMS** section, click **Create Shipment**.
    This opens the **Create Shipment** page.
2. For **DELIVERY ADDRESS**, select an existing customer's address or **New address**.
    If you selected **New address**, address fields appear. Fill out the details of the new address.  
3. Select a **SHIPMENT METHOD**.
4. Optional: Enter a **REQUESTED DELIVERY DATE**.
5. Select one or more **ORDER ITEMS INSIDE THIS SHIPMENT**.
6. Click **Save**.
    This opens the **Order Overview** page with the success message displayed. The new shipment is displayed in the **ORDER ITEMS** section.
