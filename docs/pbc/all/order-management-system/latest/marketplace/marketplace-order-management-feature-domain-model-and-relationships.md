*Marketplace Order Management* enables splitting orders into merchant orders and letting product offers be bought directly from a Storefront.
The orders are designed to be used by the Marketplace operator, while the merchant orders are always connected to a merchant. To learn more about the core Marketplace objects, see [Marketplace domain model](/docs/dg/dev/architecture/marketplace-architecture/marketplace-domain-model.html).

By using `MerchantSalesOrderFacade::createMerchantOrderCollection()`, you can decide when to create merchant orders out of an order in your project. By default, it's created by `CreateMerchantOrdersCommandPlugin`.
