When a customer places an order on the Marketplace, the *Marketplace order* is created in the system. The Marketplace order, in comparison to a regular order in Spryker Commerce OS, contains information about merchants and one or several [merchant orders](/docs/pbc/all/order-management-system/{{page.version}}/marketplace/marketplace-order-management-feature-overview/merchant-order-overview.html). Thus, the Marketplace order represents a list of items a customer has bought from one or multiple merchants in a single order.

![Marketplace order](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/Features/Marketplace/Marketplace+and+Merchant+orders/Marketplace+order+feature+overview/marketplace-order.png)

Each Marketplace order has a set of properties such as order number, order summary, payment information, date, state, shipping methods, and others.

For example, let's consider the case when a customer purchased 4 items from 3 different merchants in 1 order.
From the customer perspective, the Marketplace order is a single order with products from one or multiple merchants:

![Marketplace order structure](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/Marketplace/user+guides/Features/Marketplace+order+management/Marketplace+Order+Management+feature+overview/Marketplace+Order+schema.png)

The items in the Marketplace order are grouped by merchant and split into different shipments automatically by default. However, you can change this behavior on the project level according to your business requirements. During the checkout, customers can check how many shipments to expect and select different delivery addresses or methods based on their items. To learn more about multiple shipments, the see [Split Delivery feature overview](/docs/pbc/all/order-management-system/{{page.version}}/base-shop/order-management-feature-overview/split-delivery-overview.html).

As the Marketplace order contains details about offers and products a customer has bought from multiple merchants, the Marketplace order list with the related information is only available to the Marketplace administrator in the Back Office. <!---See LINK TO BACK OFFICE FOR ORDERS for details about how Marketplace administrators can manage Marketplace orders in the Back Office.--> Each [merchant order](/docs/pbc/all/order-management-system/{{page.version}}/marketplace/marketplace-order-management-feature-overview/merchant-order-overview.html) can be accessed and managed by the relevant merchant in the Merchant Portal.<!---See LINK TO MERCHANT PORTAL FOR ORDERS for details about how merchants can manage their orders in the Merchant Portal.-->

## Marketplace and merchant order states machines

You can coordinate the Marketplace and merchant orders processing by triggering the state machine events.

For details about the Marketplace and merchant order state machines, see [Marketplace and merchant state machines](/docs/pbc/all/order-management-system/{{page.version}}/marketplace/marketplace-order-management-feature-overview/marketplace-and-merchant-state-machines-overview/marketplace-and-merchant-state-machines-overview.html).

For details about how the two state machines interact with each other, see [Marketplace and merchant state machine interactions](/docs/pbc/all/order-management-system/{{page.version}}/marketplace/marketplace-order-management-feature-overview/marketplace-and-merchant-state-machines-overview/marketplace-and-merchant-state-machines-interaction.html).

## Marketplace order calculation

By default, calculations for the Marketplace order items are performed using the item price (product offer price or the price inherited from the concrete or abstract product), their totals, subtotal aggregation, and tax information.

The Marketplace order contains all the [totals from the Merchant orders](/docs/pbc/all/order-management-system/{{page.version}}/marketplace/marketplace-order-management-feature-overview/merchant-order-overview.html) and is defined by the following formula:

{% info_block infoBox "Info" %}

Marketplace Sales Order Total = ∑ Merchant Order Totals + ∑ Marketplace Sales Order Expense Totals

{% endinfo_block %}

At the same time, each Marketplace Order Total includes the sum of the respective Merchant Order Totals, for example:

- Marketplace Sales Order Subtotal = Merchant Order Subtotal 1 + Merchant Order Subtotal 2 + Merchant Order Subtotal n.
- Marketplace Sales Order Discount Total = ∑ Discount Totals included in all Merchant Orders. Check [Marketplace Promotions and Discounts feature overview](/docs/pbc/all/discount-management/{{page.version}}/marketplace/marketplace-promotions-discounts-feature-overview.html) to learn how the discounts are calculated.
- Marketplace Sales Order Tax Total= ∑ Merchant Order Tax Totals.
- Marketplace Sales Order Grand Total = ∑ Merchant Order Grand Totals.
- Marketplace Sales Order Refund Total = ∑ Merchant Order Refund Totals.
- Marketplace Sales Order Canceled Total = ∑ Merchant Order Canceled Totals.

The sum of Merchant Order Expense Totals may not equal the Marketplace Sales Order Expense Total, as the Marketplace order itself may have additional expenses or fees that do not relate to Merchant orders.

### Rounding

Rounding rules for a regular SCOS sales order also apply to the Marketplace order. The rules imply:

- The rounding is performed on the third decimal number.
- If the number you are rounding is followed by 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, round the number up. Example: The number  325.78<u>7</u>21 will be rounded to 325.79.
- If the number you are rounding is followed by 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, round the number down. Example:  The number 62.53<u>4</u>7 will be rounded to 62.53.

{% info_block warningBox "Warning" %}

In some cases, because of rounding, the amounts of Marketplace order totals can differ from the amounts of the Merchant order totals in a matter of a cent or less. You can modify the behavior by changing the rounding algorithms on the project level.
