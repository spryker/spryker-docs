The transaction can be completed with only name, email and address. Consumer then have 14 days to pay the invoice.

## DRAFT NOTE: THIS INFO IS HIDDEN TILL WE HAVE FINAL APPROVAL FROM KLARNA AND THE DEVELOPMENT IS COMPLETED.

The Klarna module provides two methods of payment:

1. [Part Payment – Flexible - Klarna](klarna-part-payment-flexible.htm)
2. [Invoice – Pay in 14 days - Klarna](klarna-invoice-pay-in-14-days.htm)

To Integrate Klarna payments, create and configure a Klarna merchant account.

We use state machines for handling and managing orders and payments. To integrate Klarna payments, a dedicated state machine should be created.

A basic and fully functional state machine is already available (KlarnaPayment01). You can use the same state machine or build a new one. In case a new state machine needs to be built, it's preferred to contact Klarna and confirm the new state machine design and functionality.

The [Klarna State Machine Commands and Conditions](klarna-state-machine.htm) trigger the operations exposed by the KlarnaFacade in order to perform the needed requests to Klarna.
