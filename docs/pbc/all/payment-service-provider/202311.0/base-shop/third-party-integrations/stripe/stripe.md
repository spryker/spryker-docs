[Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-de) is a financial infrastructure platform that enables businesses to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities.

The Stripe integration in Spryker is part of the App Composition Platform and supports both the default Storefront Yves and Spryker GLUE APIs.

## Supported business models

The Stripe App supports B2B and B2C models.

## Stripe features

- Interface within the Spryker ACP catalog to connect with Stripe: You can connect to Stripe from the App Composition Platform.
- Easy switch between Test and Live modes: You can test payments in either mode.
- Responsive Redirect Payment Page: Once a connection is set up between Spryker and Stripe, upon checkout, end users are redirected to a Spryker-hosted payment page where they can view activated payment methods. This works both on the web and mobile.
- Viewing the activated payment methods in the Stripe dashboard.
- GLUE API support: Support for customers using Spryker headless.
- Authorize payments and capture later: The default OMS configuration lets you authorize cards and capture the order amount either after shipping or based on the established business logic.
- Refunds: The default OMS configuration refunds a provided for whole orders or individual items.
- Payment cancellation: With the default OMS configuration, payments can be cancelled before they are captured.
- Default OMS Configuration: We provide a default OMS configuration that you can use as an example or modify to align with your business logic.

## Stripe payment methods

The Stripe app supports all payments enabled by Stripe in your region. For more information, see [Payment methods in Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/payment-methods/overview).
However, our team only tested the following payment methods:
- Cards: including Visa and Mastercard
- Debit card
- Bank transfer: supported in some regions, see [Bank transfer payments](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/bank-transfers)
- PayPal
- Klarna
- Apple Pay
- Google Pay
- Direct Debit (SEPA) / Sofort√ºberweisung
- iDEAL
- Link
- Przelewy24
- Giropay


## Current limitations

The Stripe App has limited or no support for the following features:
- Payment authorization and capture: The current logic works with separate authorization and capture. Hence, all payment methods go through this transition.
- Payment authorization timeout: There is currently a one day timeout for authorizing payments. Payment methods, like bank transfers, which are not authorized within this timeframe, will experience a timeout. We recommend extending the timeout from one day to seven days.
- Multi-capture: Partial capture of payment for order items.
- Payments can be properly canceled only from the the Back Office and not from the Stripe Dashboard.
- Payments can't be partially canceled. We create one payment intent per order and it can either be authorized or fully cancelled.
- When you cancel an item on the order details page, all order items are canceled.
