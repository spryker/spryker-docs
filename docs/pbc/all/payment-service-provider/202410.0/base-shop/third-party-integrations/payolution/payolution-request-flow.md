Both [invoice](/docs/pbc/all/payment-service-provider/{{page.version}}/base-shop/third-party-integrations/payolution/integrate-the-invoice-payment-method-for-payolution.html) and [installment](/docs/pbc/all/payment-service-provider/{{page.version}}/base-shop/third-party-integrations/payolution/integrate-the-installment-payment-method-for-payolution.html) payment methods utilize the same request flow. It basically consists of the following requests:
* Calculation (for instalment only): to calculate the instalment amounts, dues, and durations.
* Optional: Pre-check: to check the user information in order to make sure that all the needed information is correct before doing the actual pre-authorization.
* Pre-authorize: to perform a payment risk check which is a mandatory step before every payment. The payment is basically considered accepted when it's authorized.
* Re-authorize: to update an existing authorization if necessary.
* Revert: to cancel the authorization step which basically cancels the payment before capturing.
* Capture: to capture the payment and receive money from the buyer.
* Refund: to refund the buyer when returning products.
