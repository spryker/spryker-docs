Payment methods are configured to redirect the customer to a specific return URL after the payment process is completed, failed, or cancelled. This document provides information on how to change the default return URLs for payments.

Some third-party integrations only use a return URL while others can also use a failure and/or cancel URLs. The `ForeignPayment` class is used to send the expected return URLs to the payment app, which are then used when needed.

To change the default return URLs, you can use the following methods:

- `\Spryker\Zed\Payment\PaymentConfig::getSuccessRoute()`
- `\Spryker\Zed\Payment\PaymentConfig::getCancelRoute()`
- `\Spryker\Zed\Payment\PaymentConfig::getCheckoutSummaryPageRoute()`
