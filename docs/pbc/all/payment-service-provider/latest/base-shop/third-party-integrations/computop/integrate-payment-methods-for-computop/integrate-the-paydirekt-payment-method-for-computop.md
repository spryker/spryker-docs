Example State Machine:

![Click Me](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/Technology+Partners/Payment+Partners/Computop/computop-paydirekt-flow-example.png)

## Front-end Integration

To adjust the frontend appearance, provide the following templates in your theme directory:
`src/<project_name>/Yves/Computop/Theme/<custom_theme_name>/paydirekt.twig`

## State Machine Integration

The Computop provides a demo state machine for Paydirekt payment method which implements Authorization/Capture flow.

To enable the demo state machine, extend the configuration with the following values:

```php
 <?php
$config[SalesConstants::PAYMENT_METHOD_STATEMACHINE_MAPPING] = [
 ...
 ComputopConfig::PAYMENT_METHOD_PAYDIREKT => 'ComputopPaydirekt',
];

$config[OmsConstants::ACTIVE_PROCESSES] = [
 ...
 'ComputopPaydirekt',
];
```

## Paydirekt Payment Flow

1. There is a radio button on "Payment" step.
 After submitting the order the customer will be redirected to the Computop (Paygate form implementation). The GET consists of 3 parameters:
- Data (encrypted parameters such as currency, amount, description)
- Length (length of 'data' parameter)
- Merchant id (assigned by Computop)
Customer sets up all data just after the redirect to Computop.
Init action: "Authorization". There is no Order call provided for this payment method.
2. By default, on success the customer  will be redirected to "Success" step. The response contains `payId`. On error, the customer  will be redirected to "Payment" step with the error message by default. Response data is stored in the DB.
3. Capture/Refund and Cancel actions are implemented in the admin panel (on manage order). On requests, Spryker will use `payId` parameter stored in the DB to identify a payment.

## Set Up Details

 Credits are possible up to 200% of the captured amount if such setup is enabled for the merchant and that payment method within Paygate by Computop helpdesk.
