CrefoPay module can have different capture and refund processes:

- separate transaction for each order item and expense;
- combined transaction for all order items.

For these purposes, the module has different OMS plugins:

- `CapturePlugin`
- `CaptureSplitPlugin`
- `RefundPlugin`
- `RefundSplitPlugin`

You can use the following settings to manage expenses behavior:

- `$config[CrefoPayConstants::CAPTURE_EXPENSES_SEPARATELY]`
- `$config[CrefoPayConstants::REFUND_EXPENSES_WITH_LAST_ITEM]`

With `CapturePlugin` in place, the amount of items in order is captured as one transaction. If you use `$config[CrefoPayConstants::CAPTURE_EXPENSES_SEPARATELY]`, separate transaction will be created for all expenses. `CaptureSplitPlugin` triggers a separate transaction for each order item.

`RefundSplitPlugin` triggers a separate refund call for each order item that you want to refund. `RefundPlugin` implemented for case when you want to refund amount that can be more than item amount.

{% info_block warningBox "Note" %}

You'll get an exception if you trigger Refund process for items with different CaptureIDs (items captured in different transactions).

{% endinfo_block %}

`$config[CrefoPayConstants::REFUND_EXPENSES_WITH_LAST_ITEM]` allows you to refund expenses. It refunds them after the last item has been refunded.
