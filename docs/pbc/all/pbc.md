Packaged Business Capabilities (PBCs) are capabilities that enclose a certain functionality with the Spryker system. PBCs provide a good foundation for decision makers throughout multiple business entities.

This section is in beta because not all the PBCs are covered. Marketplace functionalities will also be added at a later stage. You are welcome to use the docs that are already here, and we will keep adding the docs for the rest of the PBCs.
