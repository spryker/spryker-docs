## Prerequisites

- [Create an abstract product or product bundle](/docs/pbc/all/product-information-management/{{site.version}}/base-shop/manage-in-the-back-office/products/manage-abstract-products-and-product-bundles/create-abstract-products-and-product-bundles.html) to add scheduled prices to.

- Review the [reference information](#reference-information-add-scheduled-prices-to-abstract-products-and-product-bundles) before you start, or look up the necessary information as you go through the process.

## Import scheduled prices for abstract products and product bundles

If you want to add more than five scheduled prices, it might be quicker to [import the scheduled prices](/docs/pbc/all/price-management/{{site.version}}/base-shop/manage-in-the-back-office/create-scheduled-prices.html).

## Add a scheduled price to an abstract product or product bundle

1. Go to **Catalog&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Products**.
2. Next to the product you want to add a scheduled price for, click **Edit**.
3. On the **Edit Product Abstract: {SKU}** page, click the **Scheduled Prices** tab.
4. Click **Add scheduled price**.
5. Select a **STORE**.
6. Select a **CURRENCY**.
7. Enter a **NET PRICE**.
8. Optional: Enter a **GROSS PRICE**.
9. Select a **PRICE TYPE**.
10. Select a **START FROM (INCLUDED)** date and time.
11. Select a **FINISH AT (INCLUDED)** date and time.
12. Click **Save**.
    This opens the *Edit Product* page with the success message displayed. The scheduled price you've added is displayed in the table.

**Tips and tricks**
<br>You can add multiple scheduled prices for the same abstract product. Repeat the prior steps until you add the desired number of scheduled prices.
