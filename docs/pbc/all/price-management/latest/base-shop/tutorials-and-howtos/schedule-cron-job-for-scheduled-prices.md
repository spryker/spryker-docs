By default, the cron job runs every day at 00:06:00-00:00. You can change the frequency, date and time of running the cron job by modifying the `'schedule'` key in `config/Zed/cronjobs/jobs.php`:

```php
...
/* PriceProductSchedule */
$jobs[] = [
    'name' => 'apply-price-product-schedule',
    'command' => '$PHP_BIN vendor/bin/console price-product-schedule:apply',
    'schedule' => '0 6 * * *',
    'enable' => true,
    'run_on_non_production' => true,
    'stores' => $allStores,
];
```
