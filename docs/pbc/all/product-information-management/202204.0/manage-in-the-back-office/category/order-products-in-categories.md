To order products in a category in the Back Office, follow the steps:

1. Go to **Catalog&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Categories**.
    This opens the **Category** page.
2. Next to the category you want to order the products in, click **Actions&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Assign Products**.
    This opens the **Assign products to category** page.
3. On the **Products in this category** subtab, enter **ORDER** for needed products.
4. Click **Save**.
    The page refreshes with a success message displayed. On the **Products in this category** subtab, the products are ordered per the updated **ORDER**. That's the order they will be displayed in on the Storefront. 

## Reference information: ORDER

When a category is rendered on the Storefront, its products are ordered in the ascending order of their **ORDER**. The products with order value `0` go first. If there are multiple products with the same order value, they are ordered alphabetically based on their names.
