This article describes how to add product alternatives for a product.

The product alternative is displayed on the *Product Details* page. This allows your customer to select another item with similar characteristics. It can also help your customers make a purchase if the product they initially review is out of stock.
For example, if smartphone 1 is out of stock, or discontinued, you can set smartphone 2 to be its alternative.

## Prerequisites

To start working with product alternatives, go to **Catalog&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Products**.

## Adding product alternatives for a product

1. On the *Edit Concrete Product* page, switch to the *Product Alternatives* tab.
2. To add product alternatives, enter _Product Name_ or its _SKU_ in the **Add Product Alternative by Name** or **SKU** field.
