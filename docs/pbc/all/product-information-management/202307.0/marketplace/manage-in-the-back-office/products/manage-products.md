This document describes how to manage abstract and concrete products.

To start managing products, go to **Catalog&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Products**.

## Activating products

The abstract product is inactive until at least one product variant is activated. There is no other option to activate the abstract product.

To activate a product:

1. Navigate to the product variant of the product that you want to activate:
  **Edit&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Variants&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Edit product variant**.
2. In the top right corner of the *Edit Concrete Product* page, click **Activate**.
The product turns visible to the customers of your marketplace.

{% info_block infoBox "Note" %}

Each variant needs to be activated in order to be visible to your customers.

{% endinfo_block %}

**Tips & tricks**
<br>If you want to hide the product variant from your customers, you deactivate it using the same procedure as for activating the product. This deactivates only the product variant. The abstract product is active until at least one its variant is active.

## Viewing products

To view the product details without actually editing them, do the following:

1. In the _Actions_ column of the abstract product you want to view, click **View**.
2. On the *View Product* page, you can navigate to the view product variant, initiate the editing flow for it, or manage its attributes.

**Tips & tricks**

<br>If you notice something you would like to change for your product, in the top right corner of the page. click **Edit**.

## Approving and denying marketplace products

To make the newly created products visible on the Storefront, the marketplace administrator should approve them. If the marketplace administrator does not want to display the products on the Storefront, they deny the products.

To update the approval status of the product, in the _Actions_ column of the abstract product do the following:

- For the product with status *Waiting for Approval*:
  - click **Approve** to approve the product.
  - click **Deny** to reject the product.

- For the product with status *Approved*, click **Deny** to reject the product.

- For the product with status *Denied*, click **Approve** to approve the product.
