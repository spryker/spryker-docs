## Retrieve a concrete product

To retrieve general information about a concrete product, send the request:

---
`GET` **/concrete-products/*{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}concrete_product_sku{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}***

---

| PATH PARAMETER | DESCRIPTION |
| --- | --- |
| ***{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}concrete_product_sku{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}*** | SKU of a concrete product to get information for. |

### Request

| STRING PARAMETER | DESCRIPTION | EXEMPLARY VALUES |
| --- | --- | --- |

{% info_block warningBox "Performance" %}

* For performance and bandwidth usage optimization, we recommend filtering out only the needed information using the `fields` string parameter.

* If you include more resources, you can still use the `fields` string parameter to return only the needed fields. For example, `GET http://glue.mysprykershop.com/concrete-products/fish-1-1?include=sales-units&fields[concrete-products]=name,description&fields[sales-units]=conversion,precision`.
