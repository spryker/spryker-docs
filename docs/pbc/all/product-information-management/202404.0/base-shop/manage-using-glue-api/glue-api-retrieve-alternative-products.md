The _Alternative Products_ feature allows customers to find a substitute for a product that runs out of stock or is no longer available for other reasons. The feature is particularly useful when a certain product becomes discontinued. In this case, customers usually look for an up-to-date generation of the same product, and suggesting possible alternatives is crucial. For more details, see [Alternative Products](/docs/pbc/all/product-information-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/feature-overviews/alternative-products-feature-overview.html) and [Discontinued Products](/docs/pbc/all/product-information-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/feature-overviews/product-feature-overview/discontinued-products-overview.html).

The Product Alternatives API provides access to alternative products via REST API requests. In particular, you can:

* Find out whether a concrete product is discontinued.
* Retrieve a list of alternative products of a product.

In your development, the endpoints help to:

* Provide alternatives for a product that runs out or unavailable, for example, because of local restrictions.
* Provide alternatives if a product is discontinued.
* Make alternative products available to customers in their shopping list or suggestions area to make searching and comparing similar products easier.


## Installation

For detailed information on the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see [Install the Alternative Products Glue API](/docs/pbc/all/product-information-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/install-and-upgrade/install-glue-api/install-the-alternative-products-glue-api.html).


## Check if a product is discontinued

Before suggesting an alternative product, check if a product is discontinued by [retrieving a concrete product](/docs/pbc/all/product-information-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/manage-using-glue-api/concrete-products/glue-api-retrieve-concrete-products.html#retrieve-a-concrete-product).

{% info_block infoBox %}

It is the responsibility of the client to identify if a product is unavailable and when to provide alternatives. The API only provides information on availability, discontinued status and possible alternatives.

{% endinfo_block %}

## Retrieve abstract alternative products

To retrieve abstract alternative products, send the request:

---
`GET` **/concrete-products/*{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}concrete_product_sku{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}*/abstract-alternative-products**

---

| PATH PARAMETER | DESCRIPTION |
| --- | --- |
| ***{% raw %}{{{% endraw %}concrete_product_sku{% raw %}}}{% endraw %}*** | SKU of a concrete product to get abstract alternative products of. |


### Request

| STRING PARAMETER | DESCRIPTION | EXEMPLARY VALUES |
| --- | --- | --- |
| include | Adds resource relationships to the request. | product-labels |


| REQUEST | USAGE |
