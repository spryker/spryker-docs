This document describes how to assign product attributes to abstract products in the Back Office.

By assigning a product attribute to an abstract product, you assign it to all its variants. This is useful when an abstract product has a lot of variants with the same attribute value. Alternatively, you can [assign product attributes to a product variant](/docs/pbc/all/product-information-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/manage-in-the-back-office/products/manage-product-variants/assign-product-attributes-to-product-variants.html).

## Prerequisites

1. Create the product attributes you want to add to the abstract product. For instructions, see [Create product attributes](/docs/pbc/all/product-information-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/manage-in-the-back-office/attributes/create-product-attributes.html).

2. Create the abstract product to assign the product attributes to. For instructions, see [Create abstract products](/docs/pbc/all/product-information-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/manage-in-the-back-office/products/manage-abstract-products-and-product-bundles/create-abstract-products-and-product-bundles.html).
