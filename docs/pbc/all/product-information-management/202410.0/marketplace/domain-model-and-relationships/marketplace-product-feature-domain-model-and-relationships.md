The *Marketplace Product* feature provides a relation between Products and Merchants.
`MerchantProductAbstract` is a database table used to store data with the Product and Merchant relations. The [Product features work as in the Spryker Commerce OS](/docs/pbc/all/product-information-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/feature-overviews/product-feature-overview/product-feature-overview.html).
However, on the Storefront, there are additional plugins and widgets to support the relation between Products and Merchants.
Products are extended with the merchant's data and, when purchased, are assigned to the appropriate `MerchantOrder`.
