### Reference information: Creating a product option

The following table describes the attributes you enter and select while creating a product option.

| ATTRIBUTE | DESCRIPTION |
| --- | --- |
| Group name translation key | Glossary key for the product option group. The format is `product.option.group.name.{your key}`. For example, `product.option.group.name.warranty`. |
| Tax Set | Conditions under which the product option group is to be taxed. To learn how to create tax sets, see [Create tax sets](/docs/pbc/all/tax-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/manage-in-the-back-office/create-tax-sets.html). |
| Option name translation key | Glossary key for the product option value. The format is `product.option.{your key}`. For example, `product.option.warranty1`. |
| SKU | Unique identifier for the product option value. This value is autogenerated based on the **Option name translation key**, and you can adjust it per your requirements.|
| Gross price and Net price | Price values of the product option value for gross and net modes. Prices are integer values and, in the database, they are stored in their normalized form. For example, `4EUR` is stored as `400`. If you do not define a price for a product option value, it's considered *inactive* for that specific currency and price mode. If a price is `0`, it's considered *free of charge*.|
| Group name | Option group name that's displayed on the Storefront. |
| Option name | Option name that's displayed on the Storefront. |

    This refreshes the page with the success message displayed.
