This document describes how to manage marketplace abstract products in the Merchant Portal.

## Prerequisites

To start working with marketplace abstract products, go to the **Merchant Portal** > **Products**.

This document contains reference information. Make sure to review it before you start, or look up the necessary information as you go through the process.


## Filtering and sorting marketplace abstract products

The following drop-down menus can be used to filter the marketplace abstract products on the *Products* page:

- Categories where the abstract product belongs.
- Visibility (defines whether the product is online or offline).
- Stores where the abstract product is available.
- Approval status (defines whether the product is approved or denied by the marketplace administrator).

The page refreshes and displays the available options as soon as the filter parameters are selected.

To sort the existing abstract products, select one or more sorting parameters from the drop-down menu on the *Products* page. Choose among the following sort criteria:

- SKU
- Name
- Number of variants
- Visibility status
- Approval status

By default, the table is sorted descendingly by SKU.

## Editing abstract product details

To edit the existing marketplace abstract product:

1. Next to the abstract product, you want to edit, hover over the three dots and click **Manage Product** or just click the line. This takes you to the *[Product name]*, *Abstract Product Details* tab.
2. In the *Name & Description* pane, edit *Name* and *Description* for every locale.
3. In the *Stores* pane, in the drop-down menu, select the stores where the product is available.
4. In the *Tax Set* pane, in the drop-down menu, select the necessary tax set.
5. In the *Categories* pane, in the drop-down menu, select the categories where your product belongs.
6. Click **Save**.
