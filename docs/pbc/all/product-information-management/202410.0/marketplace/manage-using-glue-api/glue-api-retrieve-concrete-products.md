## Retrieve a concrete product

To retrieve general information about a concrete product, send the request:

***
`GET` {% raw %}**/concrete-products/*{{concrete_product_sku}}***{% endraw %}
***

| PATH PARAMETER | DESCRIPTION |
| --- | --- |
| {% raw %}***{{concrete_product_sku}}***{% endraw %} | SKU of a concrete product to get information for. |

### Request

| STRING PARAMETER | DESCRIPTION | EXEMPLARY VALUES |
| --- | --- | --- |
| include | Adds resource relationships to the request. | <ul><li>concrete-product-image-sets</li> <li>concrete-product-availabilities</li> <li>product-options</li> <li>product-reviews</li> <li>concrete-product-prices</li> <li>product-measurement-units</li> <li>sales-units</li> <li>product-labels</li> <li>product-offers</li> <li>product-offer-prices</li> <li>merchants</li></ul> |
| fields | 	Filters out the fields to be retrieved.  | name, image, description |

{% info_block infoBox "Included resources" %}

To retrieve product offer prices, include `product-offers` and `product-offer-prices`.

{% endinfo_block %}

{% info_block infoBox "Filtering" %}

* For performance and bandwidth usage optimization, we recommend filtering out only the needed information using the `fields` string parameter.

* If you include more resources, you can still use the `fields` string parameter to return only the needed fields. For example, `GET https://glue.mysprykershop.com/concrete-products/fish-1-1?include=sales-units&fields[concrete-products]=name,description&fields[sales-units]=conversion,precision`.

{% endinfo_block %}
