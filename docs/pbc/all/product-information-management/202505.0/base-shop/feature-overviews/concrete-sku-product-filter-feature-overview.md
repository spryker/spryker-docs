The *Concrete SKU product filter* feature lets a Back Office user filter abstract products by SKUs of concrete products.

For example, an abstract product with the `ABCD` SKU has two concrete products with the `ABCD-1` and `ABCD-2` SKUs. Without this feature, you can find this abstract product only by the `ABCD` SKU. With this feature, you can find this product by the `ABCD`, `ABCD-1`, and `ABCD-2` SKUs.
