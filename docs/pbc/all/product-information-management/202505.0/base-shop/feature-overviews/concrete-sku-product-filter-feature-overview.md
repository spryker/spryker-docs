The *Concrete SKU product filter* feature lets a Back Office user filter the list of Abstract products by the SKUs of the concrete products.

Example:

* an abstract product with the SKU `ABCD` has two concrete products with the SKUs `ABCD-1` and `ABCD-2`.
* with the feaure off, the Back Office user can only find this Abstract product by the SKU `ABCD`.
* with the feature on, the Back Office user can find this Abstract product by the SKUs `ABCD`, `ABCD-1`, and `ABCD-2`.
