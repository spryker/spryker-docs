- *conversion*—factor to convert a value from sales to the base unit. If it's *null*, the information is taken from the global conversions (the `MeasurementUnitConverter.php` file).
- *precision*—the ratio between a sales unit and a base unit. For example, a base unit is an *item*, and a user selects *kg* as a sales unit.
- `is_displayed`—if true, then the value is shown on the Storefront.
- `is_default`—if true, then the unit is shown as the default unit on the Storefront.
