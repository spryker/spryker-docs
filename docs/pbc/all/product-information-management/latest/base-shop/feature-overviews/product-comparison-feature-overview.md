The Product Comparison feature lets your customers compare products based on their attributes.

On the Product Details page, a customer can click **Compare** to add a product to comparison.

After a customer adds a second product to comparison, they're redirected to the **Compare products** page.

On this page, products are compared based on the attributes they have. The customer can remove individual or all products from comparison.

A maximum of three products can be displayed by default.
