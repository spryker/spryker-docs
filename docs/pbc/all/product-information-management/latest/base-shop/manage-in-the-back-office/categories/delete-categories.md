To delete a category in the Back Office, follow the steps:

1. Go to **Catalog&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Categories**.
    This opens the **Category** page.
2. Next to the category you want to delete, click **Actions&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Delete**.
3. On the **Delete category [Category name]** page, select **Yes, I am sure** and click **Delete**.
    This opens the **Category** with a success message displayed. The category is no longer displayed in the list. Products assigned to the deleted category are de-assigned and remain in the system. If the same products are assigned to other categories, they stay assigned to those. Child categories of the deleted category are assigned the deleted category's parent category.
