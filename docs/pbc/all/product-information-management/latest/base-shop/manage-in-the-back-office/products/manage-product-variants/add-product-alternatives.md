This article describes how to add product alternatives for a product.

The product alternative is displayed on the *Product Details* page. This allows your customer to select another item with similar characteristics. It can also help your customers make a purchase if the product they initially review is out of stock.
For example, if smartphone 1 is out of stock, or discontinued, you can set smartphone 2 to be its alternative.

## Prerequisites

To start working with product alternatives, go to **Catalog&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Products**.

## Adding product alternatives for a product

To added product alternatives for a product, do the following:

1. On the *Edit Concrete Product* page, switch to the *Product Alternatives* tab.
2. To add product alternatives, enter *Product Name* or its *SKU* in the **Add Product Alternative by Name** or **SKU** field.
You can add multiple alternative products.

**Tips and tricks**
<br>The product alternatives is displayed on the concrete product page only when it's out of stock or discontinued. In any other case, no alternatives are displayed. However, for each product added as an alternative one, a *Replacement for* section is displayed:

In addition to the alternatives section, a dynamic label is assigned to the product for which the alternatives are set up.
