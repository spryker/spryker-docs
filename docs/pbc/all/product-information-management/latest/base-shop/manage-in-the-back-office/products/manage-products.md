This article describes how to manage abstract and concrete products.

To start managing products, go to **Catalog&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Products**.

## Activating products

The abstract product is inactive until at least one product variant is activated. You should understand that there is no option to activate it.

To activate a product:
1. Navigate to the product variant of the product that you want to activate:
    **Edit&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Variants&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Edit product variant**
2. In the top right corner of the *Edit Concrete Product* page, click **Activate**.
The product turns visible to the customers of your online store.

{% info_block infoBox "Note" %}

Each variant needs to be activated in order to be visible to your customers.

{% endinfo_block %}
