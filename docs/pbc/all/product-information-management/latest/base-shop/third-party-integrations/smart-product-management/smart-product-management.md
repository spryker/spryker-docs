Smart Product Management enables Back Office users to generate translations for abstract and concrete products.

It supports **Name** and **Description** fields.

Translations are generated from any locale–for example, en_US–into any other locales configured in the shop.

Translations appear directly in the product edit form, making it faster to localize product content.

## Generate translations using AI

1. In the Back Office, open **Edit Product Abstract** or **Edit Product Concrete** page.
2. Next to the **Name** or **Description** field, click the AI translate icon.
   - The system sends the value from the **en_US** to the AI Translator.
   - Chosen locale is filled with translated text.
