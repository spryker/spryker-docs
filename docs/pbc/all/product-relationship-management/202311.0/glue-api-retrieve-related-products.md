Using the [Product Relations](/docs/pbc/all/product-relationship-management/{{page.version}}/product-relationship-management.html) feature, sellers can define a list of comparable or additional items for each product. You can display such items, also called related products, in search and in the cart together with the products selected by customers.

Only [abstract](/docs/pbc/all/product-information-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/feature-overviews/product-feature-overview/product-feature-overview.html) products support product relations. For more details, see [Product Relations feature overview](/docs/pbc/all/product-relationship-management/{{page.version}}/product-relationship-management.html).

The Product Relations API provides REST endpoints to retrieve the related products. Using it, you can:
* Retrieve related products of an abstract product.
* Retrieve related products of the items in guest carts and carts of registered users.

In your development, the endpoints can help you to:
* Provide comparable products on the product details pages and in search results to make it easier for customers to compare.
* Provide additional product items in a customer's cart to offer upscale variations, accessories, and other additional items for products in the cart.

## Installation

For detailed information on the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see [Install the Product Relations Glue API](/docs/pbc/all/product-relationship-management/{{page.version}}/install-and-upgrade/install-the-product-relations-glue-api.html).
