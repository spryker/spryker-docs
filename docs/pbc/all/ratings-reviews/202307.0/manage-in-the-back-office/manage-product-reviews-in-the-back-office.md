This  document describes how to manage product reviews received from the customers.

## Prerequisites

To start working with reviews, navigate to the **Products&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Product Reviews** section.

## Read a review

Next to the review you want to read, click the arrow in the very first column.

## Reject a review

Next to the review you want to reject, click **Reject**.
    This refreshes the page with a success message displayed. The review will remain in the shop, but it is no longer displayed on the Storefront. If you approve the review later, it will be displayed on the same page.

## Approve a review

A review needs an approval after a customer left it on the Storefront, or after you rejected it in the Back Office.

To approve a review, next to the review, click **Approve**.
    This refreshes the page with a success message displayed. The review is now displayed on the Storefront.
