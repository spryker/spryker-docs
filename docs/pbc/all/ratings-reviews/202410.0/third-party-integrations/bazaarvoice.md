The [Bazaarvoice](https://www.bazaarvoice.com/?ref=spryker-documentation) app lets you collect and add user-generated content (UGC) to your product pages.

{% wistia fhyuouxbpp 960 720 %}

The Bazaarvoice service offers the following UGC: 

- [Rating summaries](https://docs.bazaarvoice.com/articles/ratings-reviews/display_integration/a/rating-summary?ref=spryker-documentation), or star ratings
- [Product reviews](https://docs.bazaarvoice.com/articles/#!ratings-reviews/display_integration/a/reviews?ref=spryker-documentation)  
<!---- [Questions and answers](hhttps://docs.bazaarvoice.com/articles/#!ratings-reviews/display_integration/a/questions--answers?ref=spryker-documentation)-->

Bazaarvoice uses the content syndication approach, which means that stores using Bazaarvoice republish each others' content. For example, if a store within the Bazaarvoice's network has got a new product review, this review is shared across all other stores in the network that also have this product.

{% info_block warningBox "Important" %}

To enable Bazaarvoice to match your products to products in other stores and upload product reviews into your store, you must use UPCs or EANs as unique identifiers for your products.

{% endinfo_block %}

When you connect Bazaarvoice, the app puts JavaScrip tags into your store, and the JavaScript code tells the app where to insert the Bazaarvoice contentâ€”reviews, star ratings, or questions and answers.

{% info_block infoBox "Info" %}

If you have Bazaarvoice integrated, the Spryker default the [Ratings and Reviews](/docs/pbc/all/ratings-reviews/{{page.version}}/ratings-and-reviews.html) feature is turned off. This means that ratings and reviews collected with the default Spryker Product Ratings and Reviews feature are replaced with the BazzareVoice ratings and reviews.
