8. Optional: To track whether the products that have more UGC have a higher conversion rate than those without many ratings and reviews, in **sFTP Settings**, fill out the following fields:

|----------|:--------------------------------------------------:|

| Password |   The password to connect to Bazaarvoice's sFTP.    |
| Region   | The region where your data is hosted on Bazaarvoice. |

{% info_block warningBox "Credentials and region information" %}

If you are unsure of your credentials or the region, reach out to the internal Bazaarvoice contact that manages your product feed. Alternatively, you can open a support case with [Bazaarvoice](https://support.bazaarvoice.com/).

9. In **Settings&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Select Services**, select the services that you need:
   - RATINGS & REVIEWS: These are the accumulated star ratings along with reviews that are displayed on the product details page.
   <!---- QUESTIONS & ANSWERS:-->
   - INLINE RATINGS: This service displays the star ratings directly in these lists of products, for example, in search results, in the product catalog, etc.

10. To configure the stores where you want to turn on the Bazaarvoice app, in **Settings&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Store**, select the stores.

11. Click **Save**.

This adds the Bazaarvoice app to your store. It usually takes Bazaarvoice a few days to process your product feed. Therefore, you should see the external ratings and reviews from Bazaarvoice in about 2-3 days after you connected the app.

{% info_block infoBox "Info" %}

You can do the administration work on the Bazaarvoice reviews from the [Bazaarvoice portal](https://portal.bazaarvoice.com/signin?ref=spryker-documentation). For example, you can approve individual reviews. See [Workbench overview](https://knowledge.bazaarvoice.com/wp-content/brandedge-pro-wb/en_US/basics/workbench_overview.html#log-in-to-workbench?ref=spryker-documentation) for details on how you can manage reviews from the Bazaarvoice portal.
