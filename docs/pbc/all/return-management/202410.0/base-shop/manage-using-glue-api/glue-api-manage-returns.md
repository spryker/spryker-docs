The Return Management API allows developers to retrieve return information and create returns. The list of retrievable information includes:
- Sales order items that a customer can return.
- Returns per customer.
- Predefined reasons stored in the database.

In your development, the API can help you:
- View order details, including returnable or non-returnable items.
- Create returns for the returnable items.
- View return details of a specific customer.
- Specify reasons for returning the sales order items.

## Installation

For details on the modules that provide the API functionality and how to install them, see [Install the Return Management Glue API](/docs/pbc/all/return-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/install-and-upgrade/install-the-return-management-glue-api.html)

## Create a return

To create a return for a registered user, send the request:

***
