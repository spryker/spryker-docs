The *Return Management* capability lets you create and manage returns for sales orders.

The capability consists of a base shop and the marketplace addon. The base shop features are needed for running a regular shop in which your company is the only entity fulfilling orders and handling returns. The marketplace features enable the support of multiple sellers and enable them to process returns. To run a marketplace, the features from both the base shop and the marketplace addon are required.
