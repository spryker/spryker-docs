The order of category filters defines how they are displayed on the Storefront.

To reorder category filters in the Back Office, do the following:

1. Go to **Merchandising&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Filter Preferences**.
2. On the **Filter Preferences** page, click **Edit filter order**.
3. Drag a filter item to a needed position.
4. Repeat step 3 until you drag all the filter item to the needed positions.
5. Save **Save Order**.
    A window with a success message opens.
