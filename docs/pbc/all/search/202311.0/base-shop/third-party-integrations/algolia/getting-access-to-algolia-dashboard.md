If you ordered Algolia through Spryker, to get access to the dashboard, create a **Request Help with Spryker ACP / Algolia / Request Activation** case by [contacting support](https://spryker.force.com/support/s/).

In the request, provide the email address of the user who you want to make the main admin of Algolia. The main admin will be able to invite other team members.

Algolia supports up to 19 dashboard users.

For information on setting up Algolia, see [Algolia](/docs/pbc/all/search/{{site.version}}/base-shop/third-party-integrations/algolia/algolia.html).
