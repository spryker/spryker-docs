The Algolia integration supports searching custom entities that are already indexed in Algolia but are not natively supported by the Spryker eco module (like products or CMS pages).

By following this guide, you will be able to do the following:
- Integrate Algolia search for entities other than products and CMS pages, such as docs or blogs.
- Configure entity mapping to custom Algolia indexes.

## Prerequisites

- You have access to the Algolia account in the Algolia Dashboard.
- You have integrated Algolia search in your Spryker project. For details, see [Integrate Algolia](/docs/pbc/all/search/latest/base-shop/third-party-integrations/algolia/integrate-algolia.html).
- You have an Algolia index created for your custom entity, for example, Docs, and populated with relevant data, for example, using the Algolia Crawler.


## Step-by-step instructions

The complete instructions on how to enable Algolia search for custom entities are provided in the [Algolia eco module documentation](https://github.com/spryker-eco/algolia/blob/master/docs/CUSTOM_ENTITY_INDEX_MAPPING.md).
