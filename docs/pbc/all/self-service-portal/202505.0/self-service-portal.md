The B2B Self-Service Portal (SSP) is a centralized platform that streamlines after-sales interactions, boosting operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. It brings together essential features such as asset management, inquiry handling, service coordination, file sharing, and dashboards into a single interface. This enables businesses to manage high-value or custom-built products, track service history, and maintain clear communication with customers.

Through SSP, users can submit and monitor inquiries, schedule maintenance, and access key documents like manuals and service reports. The dashboard provides a personalized overview of relevant activities and metrics, tailored by user roles and permissions. Overall, SSP enhances transparency, speeds up support processes, and ensures secure access to business-critical information.
