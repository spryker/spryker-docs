Self-Service Portal is currently running under an Early Access Release. Early Access Releases are subject to specific legal terms, they are unsupported and do not provide production-ready SLAs. They can also be deprecated without a General Availability Release. Nevertheless, we welcome feedback from early adopters on these cutting-edge, exploratory features.

The Asset Management feature allows customers to manage assets within their organization.

Back Office users can manage assets, update statuses, and edit company and business unit information.


An **asset** refers to any item, equipment, or resource that holds value and is trackable by the business.

## Creating an Asset as a Customer

1. Log in as a business user (e.g., **Sonia**).
2. Navigate to **My Account > Assets**.
3. Click **Create Asset**.
4. Enter:
   - **Image**
   - **Name**
   - **Serial Number**
   - Optional: **Note**
5. Click **Save**.

Once saved, the customer can create a new inquiry for it. See [Inquiry Management feature overview](/docs/pbc/all/self-service-portal/202505.0/ssp-inquiry-management-feature-overview.html)

You can:
- Search assets by **name** or **serial number**
- Filter by **business unit** or **company scope** (if permissions allow)
