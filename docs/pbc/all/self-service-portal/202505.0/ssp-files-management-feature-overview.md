Self-Service Portal is currently running under an Early Access Release. Early Access Releases are subject to specific legal terms, they are unsupported and do not provide production-ready SLAs. They can also be deprecated without a General Availability Release. Nevertheless, we welcome feedback from early adopters on these cutting-edge, exploratory features.
