Through SSP, users can submit and monitor inquiries, schedule maintenance, and access key documents like manuals and service reports. The dashboard provides a personalized overview of relevant activities and metrics, tailored by user roles and permissions. Overall, SSP enhances transparency, speeds up support processes, and ensures secure access to business-critical information.
