The SSP Asset Management feature enables business users to manage assets within their organization.

An *asset* is an item, equipment, or resource that holds value and is tracked by a business.

Back Office users also can manage assets, update statuses, and edit company and business unit information.

## Asset parameters

Assets have the following parameters:

- Image
- Name
- Serial Number
- Status
- Note
- Company
- Business Units
- Business Unit Owner

## Adding assets on the Storefront

On the Storefront, company account users can add assets in the **My Assets** section.

All added assets receive a pending status by default. A company user with approve permissions need to approve the added asset to make it available. Once an asset is approved, company users can create inquiries about the asset.

For more information on inquiries, see [Inquiry Management feature overview](/docs/pbc/all/self-service-portal/latest/ssp-inquiry-management-feature-overview.html)


## Adding assets in the Back Office

If you need to add assets to multiple companies or business units simultaneously, it's more efficient to do it in the Back Office.

For instructions, see [Add assets](/docs/pbc/all/self-service-portal/latest/manage-in-the-back-office/back-office-add-ssp-assets.html).



## Asset management permissions

A company user can have the following permissions related to asset management:

- View company assets
- View business unit assets
- Update assets
- Unassign business unit assets
- Create assets
