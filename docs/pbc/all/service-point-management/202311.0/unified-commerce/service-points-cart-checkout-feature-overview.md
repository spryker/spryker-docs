This feature provides an example of a replacement strategy used by Click & Collect. The strategy is needed to replace a product offer with another product offer after a customer changes a service point or a shipment type in cart.

On the project level, you can extend this feature to support more complex scenarios, like the following:
* Getting information from external systems about the offer you want to replace the current offer with.
* Have different algorithms for replacement based on information obtained from a customer.
