A Service Point represents a physical location, such as a store, post office, or other designated areas, enabling customers to conveniently pick up their orders or access additional services like returns, exchanges, or customer support. Each service point has the capability to offer one or multiple unique services to customers.

## Address substitution during checkout

The `ServicePointWidget` module provides a mechanism for substituting the shipping address with the service point address during checkout.

The following plugin handles address substitution when the cart item has a service point selected and the shipment type is set to `pickup`: `\SprykerShop\Yves\ServicePointWidget\Plugin\CustomerPage\ServicePointAddressCheckoutAddressCollectionFormExpanderPlugin`.
