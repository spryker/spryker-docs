The Shipment Type Service Point subdomain establishes the connection between shipment types and service points.

## Installation

[Install the Shipment Service Points feature](/docs/pbc/all/carrier-management/{{page.version}}/unified-commerce/install-features/install-the-shipment-service-points-feature.html)

## Modules

| MODULE                             | EXPECTED DIRECTORY                                      |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|

## Data setup

Spryker provides import functionality through the `ShipmentTypeServicePointDataImport` module to facilitate the setup of the connection between service points and shipment types.

## Address substitution during checkout

The `ShipmentTypeServicePointsRestApi` module provides a mechanism for substituting the shipping address with the service point address during checkout.

### Plugins

The following plugin handles address substitution when the shipment type is set to `pickup` and a service point is selected: `\Spryker\Glue\ShipmentTypeServicePointsRestApi\Plugin\CheckoutRestApi\ShipmentTypeServicePointCheckoutRequestExpanderPlugin`.

Additionally, you can redefine applicable shipment type keys supporting address substitution through module configuration: `\Spryker\Shared\ShipmentTypeServicePointsRestApi\ShipmentTypeServicePointsRestApiConfig::getApplicableShipmentTypeKeysForShippingAddress`.
