Wishlists are collections of products that a customer saves for further reference.

The *Marketplace Wishlist* feature lets customers add product offers and merchant products to a wishlist in the Marketplace Storefront. This way, customers save time without having to browse favorite items all over the marketplace shop.

Merchant information is displayed in the *Sold by* field so that a customer can always know which merchant is the owner of the product.

Once the customer decides to buy a product, they can add it to cart directly from the wishlist.
