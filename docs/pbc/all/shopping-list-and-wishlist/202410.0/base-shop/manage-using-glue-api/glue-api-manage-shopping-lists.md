With the help of the [Shopping Lists](/docs/pbc/all/shopping-list-and-wishlist/{{page.version}}/base-shop/shopping-lists-feature-overview/shopping-lists-feature-overview.html) feature, company users can manage shopping lists for their company to plan purchasing activities beforehand. Unlike [Wishlists](/docs/pbc/all/shopping-list-and-wishlist/{{page.version}}/base-shop/wishlist-feature-overview.html), shopping lists contain not only a list of items to be purchased but also the quantity of each item.


In your development, the resources can help you to enable the shopping list functionality in your application.

## Installation

For detailed information on the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see:
* [Install the Shopping Lists Glue API](/docs/pbc/all/shopping-list-and-wishlist/{{page.version}}/base-shop/install-and-upgrade/install-glue-api/install-the-shopping-lists-glue-api.html)
* [Install the Product Glue API](/docs/pbc/all/product-information-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/install-and-upgrade/install-glue-api/install-the-product-glue-api.html)
