A *shopping list* is a list of the items that shoppers buy or plan to buy frequently or regularly. For example, a consumer can compile a shopping list of the products they purchase every week. Shopping lists let a buyer have a quick overview of the products they are planning to buy and the sum of money they are going to spend.

A shopping list is always saved, disregarding if a company user logs out and logs in againâ€”the list is still available. The shopping list does not reserve products on stock, so adding an item to the shopping list does not affect item availability. However, a company user can easily convert any shopping list into a shopping cart to proceed with the Checkout.
There are two ways to create a shopping list:

* Through a [shopping list widget](/docs/pbc/all/shopping-list-and-wishlist/{{page.version}}/base-shop/shopping-lists-feature-overview/shopping-list-widget-overview.html) in the header of the shop.
* From the **Shopping Lists** page in the **My Account** menu. For more detailed instructions, see [Multiple and Shared Shopping Lists on the Storefront](#multiple-and-shared-shopping-lists-on-the-storefront).

New items are added to shopping lists by clicking **Add to Shopping List** on the product details page.

Company users can create not just one but multiple shopping lists to be used for different needs or to purchase products at different periods.

{% info_block infoBox "Example" %}

For example, these could be separate shopping lists for daily, weekly, and monthly purchases.

{% endinfo_block %}

The detailed information about managing shopping lists is represented in the [Multiple and Shared Shopping Lists overview](#multiple-and-shared-shopping-lists-on-the-storefront) section.

## Permissions management for shared shopping lists

Users of companies with business units can **share** their shopping lists within the company business units. The shopping lists can either be shared with the entire business unit or its members. Company users can view shopping lists shared with them on **My Account&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Shopping lists**. The shopping lists can be shared by clicking **Share** on this page as well. The **Share *[SHOPPING LIST NAME]*** page consists of two sections: **Business Units** and **Users**. Here, the shopping list owner can select either the entire business unit or individual users to share the shopping list with.
To view how to share shopping lists with business units or their members, see the [Multiple and Shared Shopping Lists on the Storefront](#multiple-and-shared-shopping-lists-on-the-storefront) section.

Three types of shopping list access rights can be granted:
* No access
* Read only
* Full access

### No access

*No access* means that a shopping list is not shared and therefore can not be seen by a business unit or user.

### Read only

*Read only* permission allows the following:

1. *Read a shopping list*. On the **Shopping List View** page, a user sees a shopping list name, owner, access level (Read only), number of users the shopping list is shared with, as well as the table of items with the following information:

* Product image
* Product name
* SKU
* Product attribute
* Product options
* Product comments (see [Shopping List Notes overview](/docs/pbc/all/shopping-list-and-wishlist/{{page.version}}/base-shop/shopping-lists-feature-overview/shopping-list-notes-overview.html) for more details)
* Quantity
* Item price
* Availability
* Actions: The **Add to Cart** button

{% info_block infoBox %}

Alternative products are not shown for discontinued products because they can not be added to the cart, and a user with Read only rights can not amend the shopping list by adding these products to it.

{% endinfo_block %}


1. *Change the number of items for adding to the cart*: On the **Shopping List View** page, a user can change the item quantity to be added to the cart.

2. *Print a shopping list*. A user can print a shopping list from **My Account&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Shopping Lists** or the **Shopping List View** page. For details, see [Multiple and Shared Shopping Lists on the Storefront](#multiple-and-shared-shopping-lists-on-the-storefront).

3. *Add shopping list items to the cart*. A user can select the necessary which are available and add them to the cart.

## Full access

*Full access* permissions allow the following:

1. *Read a shopping list*. On the **Shopping List View** page, the user sees the name of the owner, access level (Full access), the number of users the shopping list is shared with, as well as the table of items with the following information:
   * Product image
   * Product name
   * SKU
   * Product attribute
   * Product options
   * Product notes (see [Shopping List Notes overview](/docs/pbc/all/shopping-list-and-wishlist/{{page.version}}/base-shop/shopping-lists-feature-overview/shopping-list-notes-overview.html) for more details)
   * Quantity
   * Item price
   * Availability
   * Actions: **Add to cart** icon, **Remove** button

{% info_block infoBox %}

Besides other products, a user with *Full access* rights can see alternatives for discontinued items, which can be added to the shopping list.

{% endinfo_block %}

2. *Change the number of items for adding to the cart*. On the **Shopping List View** page, the user can change the item quantity to be added to the cart.

3. *Print a shopping list*. A user can print a shopping list from **My Account&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Shopping Lists** or the **Shopping List View** page. For details, see [Multiple and Shared Shopping Lists on the Storefront](#multiple-and-shared-shopping-lists-on-the-storefront).

4. *Edit a shopping list*. Having clicked **Edit**, the user is taken to the **Edit Shopping list** page.

5. *Change quantity for a shopping list*. The number of items in the shopping list can be changed on the **Edit Shopping list** page.

6. *Share a shopping list*. A shopping list can be shared by clicking the **Share** button or the **Shared with** link.

7. *Delete a shopping list*.

8. *Delete items in a shopping list*. The shopping list items can be deleted on the **Edit Shopping list** page.

![Shared full access](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/Features/Shopping+List/Multiple+and+Shared+Shopping+Lists/Multiple+and+Shared+Shopping+Lists+Overview+v201907.0/shared-full-access.png)

Different access rights can be granted on a shopping list to a business unit and users belonging to it. For example, a shopping list can be shared with Read only permissions to a business unit, but some of its users might be granted *Full access* permissions. In this case, these users will have Full access to the shopping list, whereas the rest of the business unit members will be entitled to Read only access.

## Search widget for shopping lists

Starting from v. 201903.0, you can integrate the [Search Widget for Concrete Products](/docs/pbc/all/product-information-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/feature-overviews/product-feature-overview/search-widget-for-concrete-products-overview.html) feature. The search widget allows adding the products to the shopping list directly from the shopping list page. The shoppers do not need to go to product detail pages to add products to a list anymore.

{% info_block warningBox %}

Without the Search widget, you can't search for products. Therefore, make sure that the Search Widget for Concrete Products feature is integrated into your project.

{% endinfo_block %}

## Subtotal for a shopping list

Starting from v. 201907.0, every shopping list has a subtotal for all the items added to the shopping list according to the selected Price Mode and Currency.

## Current constraints

We do not support product options in Subtotal of the Shopping Lists. For example, a shopping list includes 3 office chairs, each of which costs â‚¬15. The subtotal shows â‚¬45 for 3 items. But if you add a product option, for example, gift wrapping for â‚¬5 each to these three office chairs, the subtotal displays â‚¬60 (â‚¬15/chair + â‚¬5/gift wrapping * 3). However, the shopping list displays just the product priceâ€”â‚¬45.
