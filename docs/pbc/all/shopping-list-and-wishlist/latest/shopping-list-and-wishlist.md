The *Shopping List and Wishlist* capability lets your customers create and manage shopping lists and wishlists on the Storefront.

The capability consists of a base shop and the marketplace addon. The base shop features enable customers to add regular items to shopping lists and wishlists. With the marketplace features,  customers can add product offers and marketplace items to their lists, as well as see which merchant is selling each added item. To run a marketplace, the features from both the base shop and the marketplace addon are required.
