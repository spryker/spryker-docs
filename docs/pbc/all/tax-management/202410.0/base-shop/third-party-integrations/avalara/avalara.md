*Avalara AvaTax* is a cloud-based software that provides the latest sales and tax calculations to your shopping cart or invoicing system at the point of purchase, while accounting for the following:

* Tax rates for each state, county, and city.
* Laws, rules, and jurisdiction boundaries.
* Special circumstances like tax holidays and product exemptions.

When calculating taxes, Avalara takes the items' [warehouse addresses](/docs/pbc/all/warehouse-management-system/{{page.version}}/base-shop/inventory-management-feature-overview.html#defining-a-warehouse-address) into account. Therefore, each order item you calculate a tax for, must have a warehouse assigned. To learn how warehouses are assigned to order items by default, see [Avalara: Warehouse assignment to order items](/docs/pbc/all/warehouse-management-system/{{page.version}}/base-shop/inventory-management-feature-overview.html#avalara-warehouse-assignment-to-order-items).
