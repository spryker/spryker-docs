This document describes how to assign customers to users, so that users can [preview CMS pages](/docs/pbc/all/content-management-system/{{page.version}}/base-shop/manage-in-the-back-office/pages/preview-cms-pages.html) as the customers that are assigned to them. This is especially relevant for B2B scenarios. For example, users can see company specific prices and product lists.
