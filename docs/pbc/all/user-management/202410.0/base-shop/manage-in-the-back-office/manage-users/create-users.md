This document describes how to create users in the Back Office.

## Prerequisites

- If you are new to the **Users** section, you might want to start with [Best practices: Managing users and their permissions with roles and groups](/docs/pbc/all/user-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/manage-in-the-back-office/best-practices-manage-users-and-their-permissions-with-roles-and-groups.html).
- Create at least one user group. For instructions, see [Create user groups](/docs/pbc/all/user-management/{{page.version}}/base-shop/manage-in-the-back-office/manage-user-groups/create-user-groups.html).
- Review the [reference information](#reference-information-create-users) before you start or look up the necessary information as you go through the process.

## Create a user

1. Go to **Users&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Users**.
2. On the **Users** page, click **Add New User**.
3. On the **Create new User** page, enter an **E-MAIL**.
4. Enter a **PASSWORD**.
5. For **REPEAT PASSWORD**, enter the same password once again.
6. Enter a **FIRST NAME**.
7. Enter a **LAST NAME**.
8. For **ASSIGNED GROUPS**, select one or more user groups you want to assign this user to.
9. Optional: To make this user an agent, select **THIS USER IS AN AGENT IN STOREFRONT**.
10. Optional: To make the user a warehouse user, select **WAREHOUSE USER**.
11. For **INTERFACE LANGUAGE**, select a language suitable for the user.
12. Click **Create**.

This opens the **Users** page with the success message displayed. The created user is displayed in the list.
