This document describes how to create user groups.

## Prerequisites

- If you are new to the **Users** section, you might want to start with [Best practices: Managing users and their permissions with roles and groups](/docs/pbc/all/user-management/latest/base-shop/manage-in-the-back-office/best-practices-manage-users-and-their-permissions-with-roles-and-groups.html).
- Create at least one user role. For instructions, see [Create user roles](/docs/pbc/all/user-management/latest/base-shop/manage-in-the-back-office/manage-user-groups/create-user-groups.html).
- Review the [reference information](#reference-information-create-user-groups) before you start, or look up the necessary information as you go through the process.

## Creating groups

1. Go to **Users&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> User Groups**.
2. Click **Create Group**.
3. On the **Create new Group**, page enter a **TITLE**.
4. Select one or more **ASSIGNED ROLES**.
5. Click **Save**.
    This opens the **Edit Group** page with the success message displayed.
