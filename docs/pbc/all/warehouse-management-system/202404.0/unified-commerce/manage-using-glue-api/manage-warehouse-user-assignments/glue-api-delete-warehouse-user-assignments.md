A warehouse user can have multiple warehouses assigned to them. However, because a user can be physically present only in one warehouse, a single warehouse assignment can be active for them at a time. This endpoint lets you delete warehouse user assignments.

## Installation

For detailed information about the modules that provide the API functionality and related installation instructions, see:

* [Install the Warehouse picking feature](/docs/pbc/all/warehouse-management-system/{{page.version}}/unified-commerce/install-and-upgrade/install-the-warehouse-picking-feature.html)
* [Install the Warehouse User Management feature](/docs/pbc/all/warehouse-management-system/{{page.version}}/unified-commerce/install-and-upgrade/install-the-warehouse-user-management-feature.html)
