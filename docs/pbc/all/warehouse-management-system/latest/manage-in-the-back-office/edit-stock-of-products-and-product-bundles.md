## Reference information: Edit stock of products and product bundles

| ATTRIBUTE | DESCRIPTION |
| --- | --- |
| STOCK TYPE | Name of the warehouse the stock is located in. |
| QUANTITY | Number of products in stock per warehouse. Accept decimals with up to 10 digits after the decimal separator and 20 digits in total. When you edit stock of a product variant belonging to a product bundle, the bundle's availability is calculated dynamically. For an example, see [Reference information: Availability calculation of product bundles](#reference-information-availability-calculation-of-product-bundles). |
| NEVER OUT OF STOCK | Defines if the product is available regardless of its stock per warehouse. Even if **QUANTITY** is 0, customers can still order the product. This is usually useful for digital items like gift cards. Setting this option for a real product may cause overbooking. |
| Available in stores | Defines the stores which the stock is available in per warehouse. |

### Reference information: Availability calculation of product bundles

Let's say you have two products: a smartphone and three glass screen protectors for it. They are sold both as separate products and as a bundle. This means that a customer can buy each of the products separately or buy a "smartphone+3 glass screen protectors" bundle.

Each product has its own stock and availability value. Also, there is the availability of the bundle which is calculated based on each separate item's availability. The bundle consists of one smartphone and three glasses. This means that the bundle is only available when the following separate products meet the requirements:
- Smartphone: at least one in stock.
- Glass screen protector: at least three in stock.

If only two screen protectors are available, regardless of the smartphone's stock, the bundle is not available.
