The *Warehouse Management System* capability lets you create and manage warehouses and their stock.

The capability consists of a base shop and the marketplace addon. The base shop features are needed for running a regular shop in which the warehouse entity represents physical warehouses which store the products in the shop. The marketplace features let you create a virtual warehouse per merchant and manage the stock of their products. To run a marketplace, the features from both the base shop and the marketplace addon are required.
