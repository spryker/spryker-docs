When you have completed the instructions on [front end](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/ht-invoice-payment-fe), [back end](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/ht-invoice-payment-be) and [shared](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/en/ht-invoice-payment-fe-be-shared) implementation, you are able to test the payment method you just implemented.

 This is the last step for this tutorial.

All you need to do is to submit a new order from Yves. After that you can control the flow of the order in the Back Office.
