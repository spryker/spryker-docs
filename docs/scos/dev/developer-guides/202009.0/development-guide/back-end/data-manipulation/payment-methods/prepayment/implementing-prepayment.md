{% info_block infoBox "Prepayment" %}

{% endinfo_block %}

In this HowTo section, we will add a new module called `PaymentMethods`.

If this is your first time creating a new module, see [Tutorial - Adding a New Module](/docs/scos/dev/developer-guides/202009.0/development-guide/back-end/data-manipulation/data-enrichment/extending-spryker/adding-a-new-module.html).
