The _Resource Sharing_ feature allows for creating a unique URL for any entity in the Spryker Commerce OS. For each entity, you should use an additional connector-module. For example, to share a cart through a URL, _Resource Sharing_ should be combined with _Persistent Cart Sharing_.


To learn more about the feature and to find out how end users use it, see [Resource Sharing feature overview](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/resource-sharing-feature-overview.html) for business users.
