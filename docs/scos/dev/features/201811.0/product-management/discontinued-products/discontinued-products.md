Providing the best cost-performance services and products is the key mission of every B2B company. From time to time, a company may decide to discontinue a product. By discontinuing a product, the merchant stops producing and supporting a product. The [SCOS](/docs/scos/dev/about-spryker/201811.0/about-spryker.html) Discontinued Products feature, allows Back Office users to mark products as "discontinued" in the Back Office and show the customer that the product is no longer available. Also, shop owners can temporarily deactivate products for a set period of time
