Shop owners can help visitors to explore products that are related to the one they are currently looking at. Product Relations let you define a list of items that will be displayed as comparable or additional products.

To up-sell items, you can build a set of suggestions to offer upscale product versions or additional fixtures to maximize the cart value. You can also easily establish product associations that let your customers see recommendations of products they might also like.

You can choose to either use Spryker's condition rule builder to manually define relations or import the information from an external source.

{% info_block infoBox %}
Product relations are build on a base of abstract products, not concrete products.

To summarize, you can:

* Type: **Upselling** - Display one to many similar products in the cart.
