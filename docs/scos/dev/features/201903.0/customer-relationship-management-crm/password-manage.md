All accounts are password protected. Therefore all customers are asked to provide their unique passwords during the registration. As well as each time a customer logs into the store, the email address and password values must be provided.

If the customer account is created via the **Customers > Customers** section in the Back Office, a store administrator selects the **Send password token through email** check-box and the new customer receives an email with a link to the page where the password can be changed.

Also, passwords can easily be restored with a restore-password link.
