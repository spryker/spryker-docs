A Feature is a specific aspect of a Capability, for example, the Inventory Management Capability includes the features, **Stock and Availability Management** and **Multiple Warehouse Stock Management** . All the features together help to define the exact scope of a Capability. This helps us to guide you to the relevant functionality you are looking for.
