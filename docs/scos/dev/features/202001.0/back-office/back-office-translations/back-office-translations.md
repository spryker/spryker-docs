With ever-evolving technologies and new ways to connect, more and more businesses seek to expand their teams by hiring employees from different countries across the globe. While being true experts in their respective fields, some of the employees might be uncomfortable with using the administrative interface in English. The others, no matter how good their English is, would still prefer working in their native language.

The Spryker Commerce OS enables Shop Administrators to translate the Administration interface (Zed) into English and German languages by default and integrate any other language depending on their needs. The Back Office Translations feature allows separate user accounts to have different Zed interface languages with custom translations which can be modified any time. By offering the Admin UI in different languages, you will reach out to global markets, build a multi-cultural team which will further increase your conversion rates.
