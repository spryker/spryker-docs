Tailor the customer registration to your needs. 

A customer can simply register with an email address and a password or you can choose to ask for more details.

Once a customer enters the required information, a customer account is created.

{% info_block infoBox %}
All the required information is marked with an asterisk.
{% endinfo_block %}

In the Back Office you, as a Back Officer, will be able to see the Registration Date for each user that creates a profile. 

This information is stored in the **Back Office > Customers > Customers** section. As well as all the details entered by the customer during registration are stored in that section.
