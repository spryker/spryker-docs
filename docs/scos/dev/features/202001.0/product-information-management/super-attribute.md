Super Attributes in the Spryker Commerce OS are used to distinguish between the different Product Variants of an abstract product. Super Attributes define each Concrete Product and can consist of whichever distinguishing feature you wish to highlight, such as size or color. This information can either be manually managed or imported and processed automatically.

Consider the example of a T-shirt, the Abstract Product, that is available in the sizes small, medium, and large, three different Product Variants. The Abstract Product "T-shirt" appears as a search result. On the product detail page the customer can select between the product variants small, medium, large and put it into the cart.
