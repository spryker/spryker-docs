In B2B, B2C, and even marketplace world it is important to set alternative products for the products that are unavailable for some reasons. Imagine a situation: a user lands on a product page and learns that the specific item is not available for any reason, they essentially will have two options: either abandon the site and product search, or go look for alternatives until they find the item that fits their criteria.

Regardless if a product is out of stock or discontinued, you can effectively lower bounce rates and increase customer’s atisfaction by offering alternatives.

The purpose of suggesting the alternative products is to help the user find the “right” product, to quickly find an alternative without contacting the sales manager or customer support service.
