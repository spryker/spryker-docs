In the B2B world, shopping lists are used as templates for frequently bought items. For example, a retail store might be keeping a list of items they buy periodically to replenish stock. Also, sometimes, B2B customers might need more than one shopping list, say, one for products they buy every day, one for weekly shopping, and one more to use once a month.

With the Spryker Shopping Lists feature, you can create and manage one or multiple shopping lists as well as share them within an entire business unit or with individual users belonging to the business unit. Moreover, business units and its members can be granted different privileges on the shopping list: no access at all, read-only or full access.

Shopping lists offer the following advantages:

* Help you retain existing customers and gain new ones by allowing the customers to order frequently purchased items faster. 
* Simplify purchasing process, as not only the shopping list owner can use the shopping lists to place orders, but also the team members with whom they have been shared. 
* Give your customers more flexibility for order placements and enhances their data security due to the ability to assign various levels of access rights to shopping lists.
