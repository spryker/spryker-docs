[Module migration guides](/docs/scos/dev/migration-and-integration/202001.0/module-migration-guides/about-migration-guides.html) explain how to update a module that has structural changes, such as to the database.

[Migration Concepts](/docs/scos/dev/migration-and-integration/202001.0/migration-concepts/about-migration-concepts.html) clarify the steps you need to take to migrate in case of extensive module migrations or deprecating some technical solution.

The [Updating the Legacy Demoshop with SCOS](/docs/scos/dev/migration-and-integration/202001.0/updating-the-legacy-demoshop-with-scos/updating-the-legacy-demoshop-with-scos.html) guides will help you enhance the Legacy Demoshop with specific components of SCOS or make the Legacy Demoshop compatible with them.
