If you use Spryker Legacy Demoshop, you can enhance it with specific components of SCOS. Previously Legacy Demoshop was an example and a boilerplate while starting a project. As you already forked project codebase and started development, migration to another demo shop (Master Suite, B2B/B2C Demo Shops) is NOT required.
		
With last releases we introduced 3 new concepts: Modular Frontend (Yves), Atomic Frontend (JS/CSS) and Publish&amp;Sync. You can extend your project with these concepts. For example, you can:

* [Make the Legacy Demoshop compatible with the Modular Frontend](/docs/scos/dev/migration-and-integration/{{page.version}}/updating-the-legacy-demoshop-with-scos/making-the-legacy-demoshop-compatible-with-the-modular-frontend.html)
* [Make the Legacy Demoshop compatible with the Atomic Frontend](/docs/scos/dev/migration-and-integration/{{page.version}}/updating-the-legacy-demoshop-with-scos/making-the-legacy-demoshop-compatible-with-the-atomic-frontend.html)
* [Set up ShopUiCompatibility module](/docs/scos/dev/migration-and-integration/{{page.version}}/updating-the-legacy-demoshop-with-scos/setting-up-shopuicompatibility-module-in-the-legacy-demoshop.html), which is the key module of the Atomic Frontend
* [Configure the Legacy Demoshop to use SCOS Twig templates](/docs/scos/dev/migration-and-integration/{{page.version}}/updating-the-legacy-demoshop-with-scos/twig-compatibility-legacy-demoshop-vs-scos.html), or 
* [Make the Legacy Demoshop compatible with Publish &amp; Synchronize](/docs/scos/dev/migration-and-integration/{{page.version}}/updating-the-legacy-demoshop-with-scos/making-the-legacy-demoshop-compatible-with-publish-and-synchronize.html).
