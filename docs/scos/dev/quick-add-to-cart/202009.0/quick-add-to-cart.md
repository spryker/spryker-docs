Regular buyers, and especially B2B wholesale customers, often know what exactly they want to order from the shop—by product SKU, product name, etc. The *Quick Add to Cart* feature enables your customers to find and buy products in just a few clicks. Instead of going to each product page individually, they can go to the *Quick Add to Cart* page, accessible directly from the header, and quickly order items by typing product SKU and its quantity in respective fields. At the same time, if some specific [quantity restrictions](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/product-quantity-restrictions-overview) apply to products, they will also be taken into account when ordering through the *Quick Add to Cart* page. The *Quick Add to Cart* form can also be used to add items to [shopping lists](https://documentation.spryker.com/docs/multiple-shared-shopping-lists). Also, if a customer has a list of products to be ordered, for example, in a .csv file or other, the ordering process becomes even faster. The customer can bulk add SKUs and put quantities next to them in a single field. This being done, the customer either adds the items to cart or proceeds directly to checkout.

Placing an order through the *Quick Add to Cart* page requires significantly less navigation. This adds convenience and saves time for your new and returning customers, encouraging them to come back and buy more.
