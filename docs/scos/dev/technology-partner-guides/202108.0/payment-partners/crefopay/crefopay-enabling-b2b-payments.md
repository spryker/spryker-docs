CrefoPay module enables B2B strategy in payments.

To enable the B2B business model for CrefoPay:

1. Set `$config[CrefoPayConstants::IS_BUSINESS_TO_BUSINESS]` to true.
2. Add company data into `QuoteTransfer` on project level. It should be done before customer goes to checkout payment step.

**Company Data**

```php
$quoteTransfer->setCrefoPayCompany(
    (new CrefoPayApiCompanyTransfer())
        ->setCompanyName('Company Name')
        ->setCompanyRegisterType('UNKNOWN')
        ->setCompanyRegistrationID('registration-id')
        ->setCompanyTaxID('tax-id')
        ->setCompanyVatID('vat-id')
        ->setEmail('business.email@company.com')
);
```
