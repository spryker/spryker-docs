From the user's perspective, there is almost no difference between successful and unsuccessful order flow.

The only exception is a redirect to the URL after the `placeOrderAction` (`/checkout/place-order`) is complete. Both URLs can be configured as follows:

```php
 $config[HeidelpayConstants::CONFIG_YVES_URL] = 'http://' . $config[ApplicationConstants::HOST_YVES];

 //url which is used in case if order was successfuly handled by Heidelpay
 $config[HeidelpayConstants::CONFIG_YVES_CHECKOUT_SUCCESS_URL] = 'http://' . $config[ApplicationConstants::HOST_YVES] . '/checkout/success';

 //url which is used in case if order was unsuccessfully handled by Heidelpay
 $config[HeidelpayConstants::CONFIG_YVES_CHECKOUT_PAYMENT_FAILED_URL] = 'http://' . $config[ApplicationConstants::HOST_YVES] . '/heidelpay/payment-failed?error_code=%s';
 ```

Data flow containing information about the Heidelpay transaction error is marked red.
