The **Product Reviews** section of the Back Office is mostly used by the Customer Service.

This section allows approving, rejecting, and deleting the reviews sent by shop users.

This is how the Customer Service deals with the customers' reviews to create a list of the approved (or rejected
{% endinfo_block %} product reviews.)
