The product labels are designed for the purpose of adding a variety of information to products.
***
You can assign Product Labels to highlight specific products in your shop. Customize the look and text of the Labels as they appear in the shop. Any association can be a Label, such as "Sale" or "Christmas." Products that are new in your shop can automatically be marked with the Dynamic Product Label "New" for a predefined time range. You can add validity dates to labels, sort them by importance or relevance, and allow your customers to filter and search for them in your shop.

Labels are mapped to products to highlight them in the shop. Customers can also filter products by their labels. Abstract products that are new can be automatically marked with a "new" label for a defined time period.
