This topic describes the fields that you enter and select when creating product attributes, as well as provides examples of super attributes and product descriptive attributes.
***
On the **Product Attributes** page, you see the following information in the table view:
* Autogenerated attribute ID
* Attribute key
* An identifier that shows if the attribute is a super attribute (_true_ if yes, and _false_ if no), and the attribute type
* Actions that you can invoke from this page (View and Edit)
***
The following table describes the attributes you enter and select on the **Create a Product Attribute** page.

| Attribute |Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Attribute Key** | The name of the attribute you create, e.g. **color**. |
| **Input type** |A drop-down list with the types for data input, e.g. **text**. |
| **Super attribute** |A checkbox that defines if the attribute you create is a super attribute for an abstract product.  |
| **Predefined values** | The values for you attribute, e.g. if the attribute you create is a **color**, the values for it can be _red_, _green_, _black_, etc. |
| **Allow input any value other than predefined ones** | A checkbox that defines whether you can enter the values other than the predefined ones when creating or updating a product variant. |
| **Translation** | The translation for either an attribute key into the other language based on the locales for which you add the translation.|
| **Translate predefined values** | A checkbox that defines if the predefined values will also be translated. If selected, the predefined value itself and the **Translation** field for it appears. |
***
The super attributes are displayed in the Variants tab of the **Create a Product** page of an abstract product.

Once you select any super attribute, you will be able to select among its values.

The descriptive attributes are displayed on the **Attribute Management** page of the abstract and concrete product. Unlike the super attributes that are defined during the abstract product creation, the descriptive attributes can be added and removed at any point in time.
