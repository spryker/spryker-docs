After we created an Abstract Product List content Item with Best Selling Products or a Banner content item promoting specific products, it is time to use the Content Item Widget to insert them in a block or a page.

This section is designed to choose where to insert content items in the storefront and then decide how they will look like by selecting a template. 

In the Back Office, you can add the following content item widgets:

* Banner
* Abstract Product List that by default includes its Product Groups
* Product Set 
* File List

{% info_block warningBox %}
You can work with widgets after they have been installed for your project.
{% endinfo_block %}
