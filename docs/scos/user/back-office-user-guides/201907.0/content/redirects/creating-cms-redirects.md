This topic provides a list of steps to create a redirect in the Back Office.
***
To start working with the CMS redirects, navigate to the **Content Management > Redirects** section.
***

**To create a CMS redirect:**
1. On the **CMS Redirect** page, click **Add CMS Redirect** in the top right corner of the page.
2. On the **Add a CMS Redirect** page that opens, enter the following details:
* **Url**: Specify a URL from which you want to create a redirect link.
* **To URL**: Add a URL that you want your existing URL to be redirected to.
* **Redirect status code**: Select a status code from the drop-down list. 
3. To keep the changes, click **Save**. This will take you to the list of CMS Redirects page where you can find a new redirect URL.

On the **Add a CMS Redirect** page, you can return to the list of redirects by clicking **Back to CMS** in the top right corner of the page.
***
#### What's next?
The redirect URL has been created. However, you can either edit it or delete.
