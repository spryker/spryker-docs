## Count Orders
The very first chart you see on the **Dashboard** page is **Count Orders**. This chart provides a summary of orders made for the last 7 days.

## Orders by Status
The Orders by status chart shows you the statuses of all the orders that currently exist in the system. 
{% info_block infoBox %}
You can hover your mouse over the chart to see the details. 
{% endinfo_block %}
Once the status of an order is updated in the **Sales > Orders** section, the change is reflected on this chart.
