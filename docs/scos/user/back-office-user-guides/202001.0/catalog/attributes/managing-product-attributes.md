This topic describes how you can manage the product attributes.
***
To start managing attributes, navigate to **Products > Attributes**.
***
When you have a product attribute created, you can view and edit them, if needed. Both actions can be invoked from the _Actions_ column of the **Product Attributes** page.
***
## Viewing Product Attributes

To view a product attribute, click **View** in the _Actions_ column.
On the **View Product Attributes** page that opens, you can view the General information of the attributes, their predefined values, and translations.

You can start editing the attribute by clicking **Edit** in the top right corner of the page.
***
## Editing Product Attributes
Here you can add or remove predefined values, and edit translations of the product attribute.

**To edit a product attribute:**
1. Click **Edit** in the _Actions_ column.
    On the **Edit Product Attributes** page, the Attribute key, input type, and super attribute are disabled, as they cannot be edited.
2. You can manage the predefined values by removing the existing or adding the new ones.
3. In order to manage the translations, you need to click **Save** on the **General Information** tab.
4. Once done, click **Save**.
