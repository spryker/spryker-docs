The **Product Reviews** section of the Back Office is mostly used by the Customer Service.

This section allows approving, rejecting, and deleting the reviews sent by shop users.

{% info_block infoBox %}

This is how the Customer Service deals with the customers' reviews to create a list of the approved (or rejected product reviews.)

{% endinfo_block %}
