    * Enter the City, Zip Code, and Street values to complete the address. Number, Addition to address, Comment, and Labels fields are optional. See [Company Account: Reference Information](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/customer/company-account/references/company-account-reference-information.html) to know more about the attributes you select and enter.
3. Once done, click **Save**.
