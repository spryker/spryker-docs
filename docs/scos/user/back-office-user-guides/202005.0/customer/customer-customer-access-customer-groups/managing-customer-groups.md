This article describes how to manage customer groups.
To start working with customer groups, navigate to the **Customers** > **Customer Groups** section.

Out-of-the-box, there are no connections between customer groups and any other Back Office feature, except for the Discounts. You can set up the discount conditions to be applied to a specific customer group. See  [Discount Conditions: Reference Information](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/merchandising/discount/references/discount-conditions-reference-information.html) for more information on what the discount conditions are.
