* delete the reviews you have found abusive, inappropriate, etc.


To start working with reviews, navigate to the **Products > Product Reviews** section.

## Checking Reviews

Before changing the status of or deleting a review, you can first read its contents. 

**To read a review**, click the arrow in the very first column of the **List of product reviews** table.
