The File List section is a way to quickly review all the files from the file tree.
***
## Prerequisites
In the **File List** section, you can do the actual managing action only in case you already have the files in the file tree.

To start working with the file list, navigate to the **File Manager > File List** section.

## Viewing a File
To view a file:
1. On the **File List** page in the _Actions_ column, click **View**.
2. On the **View File** page, you see the version, file name, the date and time when the file was uploaded.

**Tips and tricks**
On this page, you can download the file:
1. Click **Download** in the _Actions_ column.
2. Follow the download pop-up instructions.

## Editing a File
To edit a file:
1. On the **File List** page in the _Actions_ column, click **Edit**.
2. On the **Edit File** page, update the attributes.
3. Once done, click **Save**.

On the **Edit File** page, an additional tab name **File versions** appear.

The **File versions** tab shows the version of the file. 
* A new version is created in case you download a new file instead of the one already used. 
* If you only update the attributes, no new version is created.

**Tips and tricks**
In the **File versions** tab, you can manage the versions by:
* Removing the not needed versions. Click **Delete** in the _Actions_ column for the version you want to remove.
* Downloading a specific version by clicking **Download**.

## Deleting a File
If the file is no longer needed, you can permanently delete it from the system.
**To delete a file**, in the _Actions_ column, click **Delete** for a file you want to remove.
