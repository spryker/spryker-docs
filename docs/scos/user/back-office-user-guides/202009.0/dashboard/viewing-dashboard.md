This topic provides an overview of the dashboard charts presented in the Dashboard section in Spryker Back Office.

To view the dashboard charts, go to the **Dashboard** section.
***
## Count Orders
The very first chart you see on the **Dashboard** page is **Count Orders**. This chart provides a summary of orders made for the last 7 days.

{% info_block infoBox %}

The x-axis shows days, and the y-axis shows the number of orders.

{% endinfo_block %}

## Orders by Status
The Orders by status chart shows you the statuses of all the orders that currently exist in the system.

{% info_block infoBox %}

You can hover your mouse over the chart to see the details.

{% endinfo_block %}
Once the status of an order is updated in the **Sales > Orders** section, the change is reflected on this chart.

## Top Orders
The Top Products chart visualizes 10 most sold products.

{% info_block infoBox %}

The x-axis shows placed orders, and the y-axis shows product names. You can hover your mouse over each line and see the number of ordered items.

{% endinfo_block %}
