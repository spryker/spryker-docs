## Prerequisites

To view product barcodes, go to **Catalog > Product Barcodes**.

## Viewing product barcodes

In this section, you can see Product ID, product name, SKU, and the barcode.

{% info_block infoBox "Info" %}

The section is designed as a reference. You cannot perform any actions. When you create a concrete product, a barcode is generated automatically. 

{% endinfo_block %}
