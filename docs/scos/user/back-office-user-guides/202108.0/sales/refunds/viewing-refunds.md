This document describes how to view refunds in the Back Office.

To view refunds, go to **Sales** > **Refunds**.

The **Refunds** page provides all the information about refunds. The refund items appear on this page when a Back Office user [changes the state of an item](/docs/scos/user/back-office-user-guides/{{page.version}}/sales/orders/changing-the-state-of-order-items.html) to **Refunded**. This usually happens when a customer returns an item or reports a faulty item.


The following table describes attributes you see when viewing refunds.

| ATTRIBUTE | DESCRIPTION  |
| --- | --- |
| REFUND ID | Unique identifier of a refund. |
| SALES ORDER ID | ID of the order this refund was created from. It derives from **Sales** > **Orders**. |
| REFUND DATE | Date when a refund has been created.|
| AMOUNT | Amount of money to refund. This value derives from the item price in the respective order.|
