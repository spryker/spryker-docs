To delete a user, do the following:
1. Go to **Users** > **Users**.
2. Next to the user you want to delete, click **Delete**.
3. On the **Delete User** page, click **Delete** to confirm the action.
    This opens the **Users** page with the success message displayed. The user's **STATUS** is **Deleted**. The user's record stays in the database, and you can reactivate it at any time.


{% info_block infoBox %}

If a user deletes their own account, they are logged out immediately.

{% endinfo_block %}
