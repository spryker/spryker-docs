The Resource Sharing feature makes sharing of different resources easy. You can generate a unique URL for any entity in Spryker. For example, you can generate a unique URL for a cart and share it with different access permissions.

For each entity, you should use an additional connector module. For example, to share carts, combine the Resource Sharing feature with the [Persistent Cart Sharing](/docs/scos/user/features/{{page.version}}/persistent-cart-sharing-feature-overview.html) feature.
