*Cart Notes* let Shop administrators include the **Notes** field on the **Cart** page. Customers can add notes to a particular item or the whole cart—for example, some special instructions about how to prepare and deliver an order.

The cart note is added to quote or to a particular item in the quote and pushed to order details.

The shop administrator can see the special request in the **Back Office: Sales&nbsp;<span aria-label="and then">></span> Orders** section:

## Current constraints

If the same product variants are added to the cart with different notes, the variants get merged with the same note.
