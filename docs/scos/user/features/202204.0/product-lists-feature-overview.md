The *Product Lists* feature lets you configure product availability for specific companies by adding their products to an excludelist or allowlist. For example, if you want to hide some products, or even a category, from a company you've signed a contract with, with this feature, you can create an excludelist of those products and assign it to the company. This lets the company purchase products from the excludelist.
