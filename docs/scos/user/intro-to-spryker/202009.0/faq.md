## Does Spryker have features?

Yes. Like iOS or MacOS, Spryker is an operating system that offers a range of features. These features consist of modules and form capabilities. Just as iOS notepad and calendar apps, you can use Spryker features as is or extend them for your business needs. So, Spryker as an operating system offers both turn-key features and its own demo apps as bases.

## What do you mean when you say "apps"?

By apps, we mean everything that is customer-facing. For example, a B2C or B2B shop system, an Alexa voice skill, an order status update function, an easy repeat-order function, a chatbot for customer service, a native or web-based mobile customer interface, EDP interfaces, and IoT installations. Apps ensure such types of services as communication between elevators or a message from an industrial saw requesting component replacement or even a booking service.
    
## Can third-party items be integrated?

Yes. We refer to third-party integrations as industry partners. They include services for payment, shipment, on-site search, recommendation engines, tracking, social, BI, loyalty, chat, and other services which can be integrated into the OS.
   
## Which new trends does your OS support?

As vendors of an operating system, our task is to ensure quick development of apps. Since ROI timescales shorten increasingly and technology develops in ever quicker succession, it is difficult to look ahead even to 12 months. With this in mind, Spryker provides a starting point from which to develop applications in such areas as voice, chatbots, blockchain, AI, and more.
   
## What is Spryker's solution for omnichannel?
    
In our world, omnichannel is a collection of apps in use, i.e., a webshop plus POS plus mobile as one possible combination. Within the operating system, we are trying to offer an increasing number of pre-installed capabilities and demo apps so that every customer can put it to work to reflect their own use case as quickly as possible. In order to avoid duplicating logic such as search, discount, payment etc. per individual channel, these items are offered or stored in the operating system. This approach significantly improves cycles of customer-facing apps building and testing.
   
## Is Spryker a shop system?
 
No. Spryker is an operating system for commerce. In our world, a B2C shop is only one of many apps. Customers who only need one app will probably be able to reach their goals faster with a standard, set-in-stone legacy system.

## Do I need my own team or can I work with an agency?

The choice is yours. You can either divide tasks and work in the OS internally, using agencies to build specific apps, or handle each app separately (i.e., an agency builds a webshop and you build a voice/chatbot).

## What are "Capabilities" in your OS?

Capabilities are groups of features that are composed of modules, such as cart, check-out, search, customer, stock, CMS, discount, order management, and another 700+ modules. We are continually adding new modules to enable you to build apps faster.

## How expensive is an average Spryker project?

The price depends on the number of apps and on the type of app you are going to build. As a rule of thumb, it is possible to build and deploy a single slimline app for most standard use cases (i.e., a voice app for Alexa or a simple chatbot) within a few weeks. The aim is to keep each app simple and relevant and to lock away as much of it in the OS as possible. This means that building a standard, run-of-the-mill webshop with Spryker does not take longer than with other systems. Spryker's real strength, however, is the variety of apps. So, building a B2C case with 4-5 apps (e.g., a shop, a web app, a chatbot, voice, and POS) using a standard system,  would be a complex, very expensive, and frustratingly slow undertaking. Unlike standard systems, such a use case is part of Spryker's DNA. Besides, in IoT scenarios, Spryker is actually better than most of other solutions due to the absence of dedicated technology.

## How might an MVP look like?

All you need to do is to define a new app from a business point of view and get started.

## Is it possible to combine various tools and solutions?

Absolutely. You can use other tools for individual apps (e.g., the shop, EDI link-up) or swap out specific OS capabilities, e.g., replace the whole native OS PIM module with your own PIM solution.
