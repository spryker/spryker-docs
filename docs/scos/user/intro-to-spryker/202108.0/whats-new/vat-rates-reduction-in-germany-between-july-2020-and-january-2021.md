On 3 June 2020, the German parliament proposed to temporarily reduce the VAT rates from 1 July 2020 until 31 December 2020.

*     Standard rate is to be reduced from 19% to 16%.
*     Reduced rate is to be reduced from 7% to 5%

If you need to adjust the VAT rate for your project accordingly, follow the guides:

* [Managing Tax Rates and Sets](https://documentation.spryker.com/2021080/docs/managing-tax-rates-sets) to update the tax rates manually in the Back Office.
