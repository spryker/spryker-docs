As a starting point to working with the Spryker Commerce OS, we created a list of all the capabilities we have to offer that arrive out of the box.

Capabilities are high-level descriptions of what a certain facet of Spryker can do. Each capability is mapped to a list of features. A feature is a specific aspect of a Capability. For example, the cart capability includes the features *Cart Functionality* and *Calculations*, *Cart Rules*, *Discounts*, and *Multiple Carts Per User*. All the features together help to define the exact scope of a capability. This helps us guide you to the relevant functionality you are looking for. Each feature has its own distinct functionality, that is, the actionable information about a feature and describes the different activities you can perform with a feature like *add*, *delete*, *modify*, and *extend*. The functionality for each feature is listed according to user type to help distinguish between content intended for developers (PHP developers and frontend developers), End users who work with the Back Office (category managers, sales, marketing, and finance, or any other people involved in creating and customizing your main interaction point with your customers), and e-commerce users (shop administrators who manage the account in the shop application).
