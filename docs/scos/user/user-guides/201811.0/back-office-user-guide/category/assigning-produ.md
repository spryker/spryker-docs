This topic describes the steps you need to perform to assign a product(s) to the category.
***
There are three ways to assign products to your category. 

* Select **Edit** for a specific category and select **Assign Products** in the top right corner of the **Edit category** page.
* Select **Assign Products** option for a specific category in the _Actions_ column on the **Categories** table view page.
* Select **Assign Products** on the **View Category** Page.

There is no difference between how you initiate the flow. In any event, you will be redirected to the same page.

**To assign products to a category:**
1. Select the checkbox next to the product(s) you want to assign in the _Selected_ column.
2. If you need to select all products displayed on the page, select **Select all** at the bottom of the table. 
    {% info_block infoBox %}
If you do not see the needed product on the page, there is no need to navigate through the pages manually. Use the **Search** field to find your product. You can use either the SKU or Name value to find the needed product.
{% endinfo_block %}
3. Once done, click **Save**.

**Tips & Tricks**
Let's say you have assigned too many products to your category and you need to remove some of them. 
1. On the same **Assign Products** page, scroll down. You will see the **Products in this category** section. 
2. Depending on the number of products you want to exclude from the category, either clear the checkbox in the _Selected_ column for specific products or click **Deselect All** (this will deselect all the products on the current page). 
3. Everything looks good now? Click **Save**.
