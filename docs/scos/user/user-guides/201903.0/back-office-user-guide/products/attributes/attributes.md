The attributes section is designed to create the super attributes that define the product variants and define the descriptive attributes that present the product features.
***
**Product Attributes**
Creating and managing product attributes is the first step in enriching your product data. It is an essential part of maintaining and improving the online shop for your customers. Attributes can serve different purposes and are therefore stored in different ways. They may be used not only for product management but also to improve search and filter functionality in the shop.
You can easily build a list of characteristic attributes for your products, such as brand or special features. For these, you can define specific values to help you and your customers distinguish between products. 

**Super Attributes**
Super Attributes in the Spryker Commerce OS are used to distinguish between the different Product Variants of an abstract product. Super Attributes define each Concrete Product and can consist of whichever distinguishing feature you wish to highlight, such as size or color. This information can either be manually managed or imported and processed automatically.
