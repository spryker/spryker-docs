The **Scheduled Prices** section in the Back Office is mostly used by Product Catalog Managers.

This section is designed to import predefined product price schedules which are to be applied to existing products automatically.

The primary uses of scheduled prices are to automate price changes and enable Back Office users to prepare for major events beforehand.
