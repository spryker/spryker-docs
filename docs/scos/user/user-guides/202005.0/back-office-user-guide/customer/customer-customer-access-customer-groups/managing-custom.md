This topic describes how to manage customer addresses and view orders.
To start working with customer details, go to **Customers** > **Customers**.
***
## Editing Customer Address
To edit a customer's address:
1. On the **View Customer** page, scroll down to the **Addresses** section and click **Edit** next to the address to be edited.
2. On the **Edit address** page, make your changes and click **Save**.

## Creating Customer Addresses
To create a new address:
1. On the **View Customer** page, click **Add new Address** in the top right corner of the page.
2. Enter the new address for the customer.
3. Once done, click **Save**.

By default, the first address added to a customer account is considered both for billing and for shipping.

If you need to have a different billing address or shipping address, do the following:
1. Create an address as described above.
2. Go to the **Edit Customer** page either from the **Customers** page or from the **View Customer** page.
3. Choose one address to be the billing address and one address to be the shipping address.
4. Click **Save**.

## Viewing Customer Orders
To view orders made by a specific customer:
1. Navigate to the **View Customer** page and scroll down to the **Orders** section.
2. To find a specific order, start typing either its Order Reference value or any other value that the table with the list of orders contains, in the **Search** field. As you type, the list of matching orders will be created in the table.
3. To view order details, click **View** - this will take you to the **View Order** page from the **Sales > Orders** section.
