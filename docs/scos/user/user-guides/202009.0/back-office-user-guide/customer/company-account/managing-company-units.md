This article describes how to manage company units.

## Creating Company Business Units

To create a company business unit:

1. In the top right corner of the **Overview of Company Business Units** page, click **Create Company Business Unit**.
2. On the **Create Company Business Unit** page, populate all required information: select company from the drop-down list and enter the name of the business unit. 
       Parent, IBAN, and BIC fields are optional and can be populated later.
3. Click **Save**. 
    The new created business unit will appear in the _Company Business Units_ table on the **Company Units** page.

The fields that you enter and select are described in [Company Account: Reference Information](/docs/scos/user/user-guides/202001.0/back-office-user-guide/company-account/references/company-account-reference-information.html).

The business units can be managed by triggering certain actions in the _Actions_ column in the **Company Business Units** table. Specifically, business units can be **Edited** and **Deleted**.

## Editing a Business Unit
To edit a business unit:
1. Click **Edit** in the _Actions_ column if you want to change the details for a business unit such as Parent BU, Name, IBAN, and BIC.
    {% info_block infoBox "Info" %}
Once the company business unit address is created, you can attach it to a business unit on the **Edit Company Business Unit** page. See [Managing Company Unit Addresses](/docs/scos/user/user-guides/202001.0/back-office-user-guide/company-account/managing-a-company-account/managing-company-unit-addresses.html
{% endinfo_block %} for more details.)
2. Once done, click **Save**.

## Deleting a Business Unit
If you want to delete an existing business unit, click **Delete** in the _Actions_ column.
