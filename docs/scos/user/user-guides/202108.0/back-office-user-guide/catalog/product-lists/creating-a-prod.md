This article describes how to create a product list.

You can consider product lists as conditions under which companies see products in a store. Let's say you want to hide some products, or even a category, from a company you've signed a contract with. You create a blacklist of those products and assign it to the company.

## Prerequisistes

To start working with product lists, go to **Catalog** > **Product Lists**.

Review the reference information before you start, or just look up the necessary information as you go through the process.

## Creating a product list

To create a product list:

1. In the top right corner of the *Overview of Product Lists* page, select **Create a Product List**.
The *Create a Product List* page opens.
2. In the *General Information* tab:
    1. In **Title**, enter a product list title.
    2. Select a type of the product list.
3. Optional: In the *Assign Categories* tab, assign categories:
    1. In the **Categories** field, type the name of a category to see the list of matching results and select the desired category.
    2. Repeat the previous step until you assign all the desired categories. 
4. Optional: In the *Assign Products* tab, assign products in one of the following ways:
    *  Import a product list:
        1. Select **Choose File**.
        2. Select the product list file to be uploaded. 
            The file should contain the `product_list_key` and `concrete_sku` fields.

    *  Assign products to the list manually: in the *Selected* column of the *Select Products to assign* table, select the products to add to the list.
 5. Select **Save**. The page refreshes with the success message displayed. 

**Tips & tricks**

* When assigning products, you can filter products by entering a product name or SKU in the search field.
* To double-check the list of products that are to be assigned, switch to the **Products to be assigned** table.

{% info_block warningBox "Concrete and abstract products" %}

If you select all the concrete products of an abstract product, the abstract product is selected too. 
If an abstract product is selected, all its concrete products are selected too.

{% endinfo_block %}

### Reference information: Creating a product list

On the *Overview of Product Lists* page, you see the following information:

* The autogenerated product list ID.
* Product list title and type (with Blacklist or Whitelist).
* The actions that you can perform with each specific product list (Edit List, Remove List).
![product-list-overview-page](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/User+Guides/Back+Office+User+Guides/Products/Product+Lists/product-list-overview-page.png)

By default, the last created product list goes on top of the table. However, you can sort and search the list of product lists.

All columns with headers having arrows in the *List of Product Lists* table are sortable. You can list the table by any available column except for the _Actions_.
