This topic describes how to manage merchant records.

To start working with merchants, go to **Marketplace > Merchants**.

## Creating a merchant 
To create a merchant:
1. On the **Overview of Merchants** page, click **Add Merchant** in the top right corner of the page.
2. On the **Create Merchant** page, enter a name of the merchant and click **Save**.

That's it. Now you have the merchant created.

In a non-marketplace environment, the Merchant record is the record of the company which sells goods and is the only one in the system. 

## Editing a merchant
To edit a merchant: 
1. On the **Overview of Merchants** page, you click **Edit** in the _Actions_ column for a specific merchant.
2. On the **Edit Merchant** page, change the merchant name and click **Save**.

## Deactivating a merchant
To deactivate a merchant, next to the merchant you want to deactivate, select **Deactivate**.

This refreshes the page with the success message displayed. The status of the merchant is *Inactive*.

## Activating a merchant
To activate a merchant, next to the merchant you want to activate, select **Activate**.

This refreshes the page with the success message displayed. The status of the merchant is *Active*.

## Next steps
Once you have the merchant record available in the system, you can proceed with creating a merchant relation.

See [Managing Merchant Relations](/docs/scos/user/user-guides/{{page.version}}/back-office-user-guide/marketplace/merchants-and-merchant-relations/managing-merchant-relations.html) to know how you create those.
