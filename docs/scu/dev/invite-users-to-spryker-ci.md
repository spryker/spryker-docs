To collaborate with a teammate, you need to invite them to your workspace and add them to a project. The only exception is the workspace owner who has access to all projects in the workspace.

To invite a teammate, do the following:

1. In Spryker CI, go to **People**.

![Spryker CI User Management - People](https://spryker.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/docs/paas%2B/dev/invite-users-to-spryker-ci.md/people.png)

2. On the **People** page, click **Groups**.

3. Select **Admins** or **Developers Read-only** depending on the rights that you want to provide to the inviting person.

6. On the **Invite new people** page, enter one or more **EMAILS** to send invites to.
    If you need to invite more than three users at a time, click **+** to add more email fields.
